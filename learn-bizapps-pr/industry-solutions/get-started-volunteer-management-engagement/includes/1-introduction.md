Volunteer Management and Volunteer Engagement enable nonprofit organizations to manage relationships with their volunteers, and the end-to-end process of engaging volunteers, from publishing opportunities and receiving applications, through onboarding and communications, to post-engagement activities and reporting.

Volunteer Management is a Power App used by volunteer managers to manage their everyday processes around engagement opportunities. Volunteer Engagement is a Power Apps Portal, which makes engagement opportunities set up in Volunteer Management available on the web, so that volunteers can find them, apply for them, and manage their profiles online. Together they make a connected, ready to use solution. Volunteer Management can be used as a standalone application or integrated with your own portal or website solution if preferred.

This module introduces Volunteer Management and Volunteer Engagement and outlines the capabilities that allow volunteer managers to use these applications to engage volunteers and manage their processes.

-   Understand the core capabilities of Volunteer Management and Volunteer Engagement and how they work together
