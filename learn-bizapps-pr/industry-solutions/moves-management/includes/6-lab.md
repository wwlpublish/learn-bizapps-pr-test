This exercise will take you through the steps of creating an opportunity and converting it into a donor commitment. You'll create a new opportunity, add in preferences, create a reporting plan, and designation plan. The opportunity will then be converted to a donor commitment where you can view both the opportunity and donor commitment on the constituent record.
