  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned. 
  questions: 
  - content: In the context of data model calculations, which statement best describes time intelligence?
    choices: 
    - content: Snapshot balance reporting
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Snapshot balance reporting is an example of time intelligence logic.
    - content: Filter context modifications involving a date table
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Time intelligence calculations modify date filter contexts.
    - content: Complex calculations involving time
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Time intelligence calculations aren't necessarily complex.
    - content: Calculations involving hours, minutes, or seconds
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Time intelligence calculations aren't exclusively concerned with time elements such as hours, minutes, or seconds. Commonly, in business data models, they're concerned with years, quarters, months, or days.
  - content: You're developing a data model in Power BI Desktop. You've just added a date table by using the CALENDARAUTO function. You've extended it with calculated columns, and you've related it to other model tables. What else should you do to ensure that DAX time intelligence calculations work correctly?
    choices: 
    - content: Add time intelligence measures to the date table.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You are not required to add time intelligence measures to the date table. It's not common to add measures to a dimension table.
    - content: Mark the date table.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: You must mark the date table so that Power BI can correctly filter its dates.
    - content: Add a fiscal hierarchy.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: You are not required to create a hierarchy, though it's usually helpful to do so.
    - content: Add a date column.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: You are not required to add a date column. Because the table was created by using the CALENDARAUTO function, a date column will already exist.
  - content: You have a table that stores account balance snapshots for each date, excluding weekends. You need to ensure that your measure formula only filters by a single date. Also, if no record is on the last date of a time period, it should use the latest account balance. Which DAX time intelligence function should you use?
    choices: 
    - content: FIRST
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The FIRST function will return the first date in the filter context. This option will not help you achieve the objective. The requirement is to filter by the last date where a snapshot record exists.
    - content: FIRSTNONBLANK
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: The FIRSTNONBLANK function will return the first date in the filter context where a snapshot record exists. This option will not help you achieve the objective. The requirement is to filter by the last date where a snapshot record exists.
    - content: LAST
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: The LAST function will return the first date in the filter context. This option will not help you achieve the objective. The requirement is to filter by the last date where a snapshot record exists.
    - content: LASTNONBLANK
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: The LASTNONBLANK function will return the last date in the filter context where a snapshot record exists. This option will help you achieve the objective.
