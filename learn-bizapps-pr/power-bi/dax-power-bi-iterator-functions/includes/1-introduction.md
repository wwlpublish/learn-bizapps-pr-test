Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) include a set of functions known as *iterator functions*. Iterator functions enumerate all rows of a given table and evaluate a given expression for each row. They provide you with flexibility and control over how your model calculations will summarize data.

By now, you're familiar with single-column summarization functions, including SUM, COUNT, MIN, MAX, and others. Each of these functions has an equivalent iterator function that's identified by the "X" suffix, such as SUMX, COUNTX, MINX, MAXX, and others. Additionally, specialized iterator functions exist that perform filtering, ranking, semi-additive calculations over time, and more.

Characteristic of all iterator functions, you must pass in a table and an expression. The table can be a model table reference or an expression that returns a table object. The expression must evaluate to a scalar value.

Single-column summarization functions, like SUM, are shorthand functions. Internally, Microsoft Power BI converts the SUM function to SUMX. As a result, the following two measure definitions will produce the same result; Power BI doesn't differentiate between these measure definitions when it evaluates them or their performance.

```dax
Revenue = SUM(Sales[Sales Amount])
```

```dax
Revenue =
SUMX(
	Sales,
	Sales[Sales Amount]
)
```

It's important to understand how context works with iterator functions. Because iterator functions enumerate over table rows, the expression is evaluated for each row in row context, similar to calculated column formulas. The table is evaluated in filter context, so if you're using the previous **Revenue** measure definition example, if a report visual was filtered by fiscal year **FY2020**, then the Sales table would contain sales rows that were ordered *in that year*. Filter context is described in the filter context module.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you are using iterator functions, make sure that you avoid using large tables (of rows) with expressions that use expansive DAX functions. Some functions, like the [SEARCH](https://docs.microsoft.com/dax/search-function-dax/?azure-portal=true) DAX function, which scans a text value that looks for specific characters or text, can result in slow implementation. Also, the [LOOKUPVALUE](https://docs.microsoft.com/dax/lookupvalue-function-dax/?azure-portal=true) DAX function might result in a slow, row-by-row retrieval of values. In this second case, use the [RELATED](https://docs.microsoft.com/dax/related-function-dax/?azure-portal=true) DAX function instead, whenever possible.
