Power BI visuals are attractive charts and graphics that you can use to revitalize your data. Visuals allow you to share data insights more effectively and increase comprehension, retention, and appeal. Visuals are a fundamental part of your report because they help your report audience connect and interact with the information to make informed decisions quickly.

After you've loaded and modeled your organization's data in Power BI Desktop, you will be ready to start creating your reports. In this module, you'll use the report editor in Power BI Desktop to add suitable visuals to your report canvas. You'll then customize those visuals to meet your organization's requirements.

Consider a scenario where you work as a Power BI developer for Tailwind Traders. Your organization wants to transform the way that it presents its data to management and stakeholders. It wants to replace the current text and tabular report format with a more visual approach so that users will find the reports more interesting. Additionally, by using a visual approach, the company can provide users with quicker, easier access to the information that they need to make their business decisions. You are tasked with creating a Power BI report that is based on a combination of visuals that are customized to match your organization's branding and report presentation requirements.

By the end of this module, you will be able to: 

-   Add visualization items to reports.

-   Choose an effective visualization.

-   Format and configure visualizations.

-   Import a custom visual.

-   Add an R or Python visual.
