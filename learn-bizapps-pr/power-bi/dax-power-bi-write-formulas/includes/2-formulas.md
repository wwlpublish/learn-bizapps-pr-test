Each model calculation type, calculated table, calculated column, or measure is defined by its name, followed by the equals symbol (=), which is then followed by a **DAX formula**. Use the following template to create a model calculation:

```dax
<Calculation name> = <DAX formula>
```

> [!NOTE]
> A calculation name cannot include leading or trailing spaces, control characters, or the following special characters: .,;':/\*|?&%$!+=()[]{}<>

For example, the definition of the Ship Date calculated table that duplicates the Date table data is:

```dax
Ship Date = 'Date'
```

A DAX formula consists of expressions that return a result. The result is either a table object or a scalar value. Calculated table formulas must return a table object; calculated column and measure formulas must return a scalar or single value.

Formulas are assembled by using:

-   DAX functions

-   DAX operators

-   References to model objects

-   Constant values, like the number 24 or the literal text "FY" (for fiscal year)

-   DAX variables

-   Whitespace

> [!TIP]
> When entering DAX formulas in Power BI Desktop, you have the benefit of IntelliSense. IntelliSense is a code-completion aid that lists functions and model resources. When you select a DAX function, it also provides you with a definition and description. We recommend that you use IntelliSense to help you quickly build accurate formulas.

## DAX functions

Similar to Microsoft Excel, DAX is a functional language; formulas rely on *DAX functions* to accomplish specific goals. Typically, functions have arguments that allow passing in variables. Formulas can use many function calls and will often nest functions within other functions.

In a formula, function names must be followed by parentheses. Within the parentheses, variables are passed in.

> [!NOTE]
> Some functions don't take arguments, or arguments might be optional.

Working with DAX functions is described later in this module.

## DAX operators

Formulas also rely on *DAX operators*, which can perform arithmetic calculations, compare values, work with strings, or test conditions.

DAX operators are described in more detail later in this module.

## References to model objects

Formulas can only refer to three types of model objects: tables, columns, or measures. A formula can't refer to a hierarchy or a hierarchy level. (Recall that a hierarchy level is based on a column, so your formula can refer to a hierarchy level's column.)

### Table references

When you are referencing a table in a formula, officially, the table name is enclosed within single quotation marks. In the following calculated table definition, notice that the Date table is enclosed within single quotation marks.

```dax
Ship Date = 'Date'
```

However, single quotation marks can be omitted when both of the following conditions are true:

1.  The table name does not include embedded spaces.

2.  The table name is not a reserved word that is used by DAX. All DAX function names and operators are reserved words. *Date* is a DAX function name, which explains why, when you are referencing a table named Date, that it must be enclosed within single quotation marks.

In the following calculated table definition, it's possible to omit the square brackets when referencing the Airport table:

```dax
Arrival Airport = Airport
```

### Column references

When you are referencing a column in a formula, the column name must be enclosed within square brackets. Optionally, it can be preceded by its table name. For example, the following measure definition refers to the **Sales Amount** column.

```dax
Revenue = SUM([Sales Amount])
```

Because column names are unique within a table but not necessarily unique within the model, you can disambiguate the column reference by preceding it with its table name. This disambiguated column is known as a *fully qualified column*. Some DAX functions require passing in fully qualified columns.

> [!TIP]
> To improve the readability of your formulas, we recommend that you always precede a column reference with its table name.

The previous example measure definition can be rewritten as:

```dax
Revenue = SUM(Sales[Sales Amount])
```

### Measure references

When you are referencing a measure in a formula, like column name references, the measure name must be enclosed within square brackets. For example, the following measure definition refers to the **Revenue** and **Cost** measures.

```dax
Profit = [Revenue] - [Cost]
```

If you are a DAX beginner, the fact that column and measure references are always enclosed within square brackets can cause confusion when you are trying to read a formula. However, when you're proficient with DAX fundamentals, you'll be able to determine which type of object it is because, in DAX formulas, columns, and measures are used in different ways.

> [!TIP]
> It's possible to precede a measure reference with its table name. However, measures are a model-level object. While they're assigned to a home table, it's only a cosmetic relationship to logically organize measures in the **Fields** pane.

Therefore, while we recommend that you always precede a column reference with its table name, the inverse is true for measures: We recommend that you never precede a measure reference with its table name.

For more information, see [Column and measure references](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/guidance/dax-column-measure-references/?azure-portal=true).

## DAX variables

Formulas can declare DAX variables to store results.

How and when to use DAX variables is described later in this module.

## Whitespace

Whitespace refers to characters that you can use to format your formulas in a way that's quick and simple to understand. Whitespace characters include:

-   Spaces

-   Tabs

-   Carriage returns

Whitespace is optional and it doesn't modify your formula logic or negatively impact performance. We strongly recommend that you adopt a format style and apply it consistently, and consider the following recommendations:

-   Use spaces between operators.

-   Use tabs to indent nested function calls.

-   Use carriage returns to separate function arguments, especially when it's too long to fit on a single line. Formatting in this way makes it simpler to troubleshoot, especially when the formula is missing a parenthesis.

-   Err on the side of too much whitespace than too little.

> [!TIP]
> In the formula bar, to enter a carriage return, press the **Shift+Enter** shortcut keys. Pressing the **Enter** key alone will commit your formula.

Consider the following measure definition that's written in a single line and that includes five DAX function calls:

```dax
Revenue YoY % = DIVIDE([Revenue] - CALCULATE([Revenue], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date])), CALCULATE([Revenue], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date])))
```

The following example is the same measure definition but now formatted, which helps make it easier to read and understand:

```dax
Revenue YoY % =
DIVIDE(
	[Revenue]
		- CALCULATE(
			[Revenue],
			SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date])
	),
	CALCULATE(
		[Revenue],
		SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date])
	)
)
```

Try formatting the measure on your own. Open the [**Adventure Works DW 2020 M02.pbix**]](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-dax-power-bi/tree/main/activities) Power BI Desktop file and then, in the **Fields** pane, expand the Sales table and select the **Revenue YoY %** measure. Use tab and carriage return characters to produce the same result as the previous example. When you add a carriage return, remember to press the **Shift+Enter** shortcut keys.

This measure definition can still be improved for readability and performance, which will be explained later in this module.

> [!TIP]
> An excellent formatting tool from another source that can help you format your calculations is [DAX Formatter](http://www.daxformatter.com/?azure-portal=true). The tool allows you to paste in your calculation and format it. Then, you can copy the formatted calculation to your clipboard and paste it back into Power BI Desktop.
