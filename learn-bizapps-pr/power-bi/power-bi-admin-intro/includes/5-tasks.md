There are several common tasks that are performed by Power BI administrators.

For the **Office 365 global administrator**, these tasks are:

- **Assigning licenses** - In the Power BI service, users have defined capabilities based on the type of per-user license they have (free or Pro) and whether the content they're interacting with is in a workspace assigned to a Power BI Premium capacity. Licenses are assigned in the O365 portal and you must be a global or user - account administrator to assign these licenses.

- **Audit logging** - Gather telemetry data, unique users - launches for Power BI users. For guidance on how to set up audit logs, please refer to this [article](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/guidance/coe/setup-auditlog/?azure-portal=true).

For the **Power BI administrator**, these tasks are:

- **Controlling access** - Control user access to record-level and task-based privileges.

- **Controlling Power BI tenant features** - Tenant settings are managed in the admin portal and can restrict capabilities and features to a limited set of users.

- **Activity log** - Knowing who is taking what action on which item in your Power BI tenant can be critical in helping your organization fulfill its requirements, like meeting regulatory compliance and records management. For additional information about tracking user activity, please refer to this [article](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/admin/service-admin-auditing/?azure-portal=true).

- **Monitoring usage** - Monitor how your dashboard and reports are being used. Views per day, unique users per day, views per user, and shares per day are a few of the metrics that can be reported on and monitored.

For the **Microsoft Power Platform administrator**, a key task is:

- **Manage gateways** - On-premises data gateways act as a bridge, providing quick and secure data transfer between on-premises data - data that isn't in the cloud, and Power BI, Power Automate, Logic Apps, and Power Apps services. For more information about managing gateways, see this [article](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/onpremises-data-gateway-management/?azure-portal=true).
