**Power BI admin portal** - Used to manage a Power BI tenant, including the configuration of governance policies, usage monitoring, and provisioning of licenses, capacities, and organizational resources.

**Power BI gateway management** - Use Microsoft Power Platform admin center to view and manage on-premises data gateways. For more information about gateway administration and management, see this [article](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/onpremises-data-gateway-management#manage-gateway-installers/?azure-portal=true).

**Microsoft Power Platform admin center** - Provides a unified portal for administrators to manage environments and settings for Power Apps, Power Automate, and customer engagement apps (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation).

**Microsoft 365 admin center** - Here you'll manage users and their license assignment and you can launch into many of the individual admin centers from here.

**Security and compliance center** - In addition to the general compliance tasks, administrators can come here to search the Audit log to see Power Automate audit events.

**Azure Active Directory portal** - Advanced Azure AD management tasks such as conditional access is managed here. If you support any developer application registration it's also done here. This is also where you start setup of your on-premises gateways.

**PowerShell** - With PowerShell cmdlets for app creators and administrators, you can automate many of the monitoring and management tasks that are only possible manually today in [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc&azure-portal=true).

**REST APIs** - Automate common Power BI administrator tasks with REST APIs. Find existing REST APIs available for automating common Power BI administration tasks [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/power-bi/admin/?azure-portal=true).
