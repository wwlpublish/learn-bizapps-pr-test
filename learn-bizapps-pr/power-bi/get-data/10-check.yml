  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned. 
  questions: 
  - content: Which query language do you use to extract data from Microsoft SQL Server? 
    choices: 
    - content: DAX
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You use this language with Power BI and Azure Analysis Services. 
    - content: T-SQL
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: This is the query language for SQL Server. 
    - content: MDX
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: You use this language with Azure Analysis Services. 
  - content: You're creating a Power BI report with data from an Azure Analysis Server Cube.  When the data refreshes in the cube, you would like to see it immediately in the Power BI report.  How should you connect? 
    choices: 
    - content: Import
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This will require the data to be imported into Power BI on a scheduled interval. 
    - content: Live Connect
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: This will reflect cube changes immediately. 
    - content: Direct Query
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: This option doesn't exist when connecting to AAS cubes. 
  - content: What can you do to improve performance when getting data in Power BI? 
    choices: 
    - content: Do some calculations in the original data source 
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Power Query and Power Query Editor are built to allow you to process the data, however, the processing power required to do this may lower performance in other areas of your reports. It is good practice to process as much as possible in the native data source.   
    - content: Only pull data into the Power BI Service, not Power BI Desktop 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: i.	There is no performance difference here. 
    - content: Use SELECT * in your SQL queries when pulling data from a relational database. 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: This might decrease performance, since you will be getting more columns and rows than you likely need. 
    - content: Combine date and time columns into a single column 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Separating date and time will improve compression and thus performance.
