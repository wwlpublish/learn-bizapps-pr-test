Microsoft Power BI gives you a wide range of methods to analyze your data and get answers to your questions. This module examines the Power BI features that are based in advanced analytics and visualization.

Occasionally, the fastest way to get an answer is to ask a question by using your own words. Power BI allows you to do exactly that method with its advanced analytics AI capabilities. One feature of Power BI is that it allows you to ask questions by using natural language, and then it will answer those questions for you.

Similarly, your dataset is likely numerical, where it consists of numbers, amounts, measures, and so on. You've been successfully analyzing this numerical data to get insights. Analyzing non-numerical data can be difficult, but with the AI capabilities of Power BI, you can analyze text data to get more insights than before. For example, you might have an abundance of comments or reviews from customers or the results of an employee survey that have been left long forgotten in a database. Now, you can analyze this additional data and transform it into valuable information.

Because the numbers don't tell you everything, you can use the AI features in Power BI to examine your data further, to see what people are saying, and to get more constructive and meaningful results, which will help you ultimately make better business decisions.

For this module's scenario, you have been building reports for different teams in your organization. Now, you want to use the AI aspect of the advanced analytic capabilities of Power BI to enhance your reports in clever ways. You want to empower users to gain new insights in more interactive ways and receive direct answers to their questions.

This module describes the AI capabilities of Power BI. By the end of this module, you will be able to: 

- Use the **Q&A** visual.  

- Find important factors with the **Key influencers** visual.

- Use the **Decomposition Tree** visual to break down a measure.
