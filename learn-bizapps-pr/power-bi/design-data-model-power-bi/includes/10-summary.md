This module explained how you can take data that is difficult to read,
build calculations on, and discover and make it simpler for report
authors and others to use. Additionally, you learned how to combine
queries so that they were fewer in number, which makes data navigation
more streamlined. You also replaced renamed columns into a human
readable form and reviewed good naming conventions for objects in Power
BI.
