You've likely had the chance to load and transform data from numerous sources, build visuals, create DAX equations, and even publish a report or two to Microsoft Power BI. The next step on your data analysis journey is to share these reports with your wider audiences and organizations. You can accomplish this task in a workspace, which is a feature of Power BI. A workspace is a centralized repository in which you can collaborate with colleagues and teams to create collections of reports and dashboards.
