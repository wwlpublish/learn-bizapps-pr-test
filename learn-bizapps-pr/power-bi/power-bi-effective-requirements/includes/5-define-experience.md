UX requirements relate to how reports deliver the expected report consumer needs. To assess user experience requirements, you should consider the audience, report type, and the UI requirements.

Other UX requirements can include:

- Support for interactions, such as:

  - Drill up, drill down, or drill through to details.

  - Navigation within the report or to other reports.

  - Filters or slicers that can be applied to report visuals, specific pages, or all pages.

  - Data export as specific data formats, such as Microsoft Excel or a comma-separated value (CSV) file.

- Support for ad hoc questions to retrieve a response in the form of a data visualization.

- Configuring of data alerts to notify people when specific data values change or exceed predefined thresholds.

- Links to open webpages.

- Actions to open applications, write back data entry values, or trigger workflows.

- What-if analysis that allows the report consumer to modify "what-if" values to understand the consequences of different scenarios. For example, what-if analysis could allow consumers to predict sales revenue based on different consumer demand estimates.

- Page layouts that can extend over multiple pages and are suitable for printing as multi-page documents.

- Printing the report to a physical printer or as a PDF document.

- Subscribing to the report so that it can be automatically delivered as a document on a scheduled basis.

- Adding commentary, feedback, or engaging in a conversation about the report.
