title: Establish a data access infrastructure in Power BI 
summary: |  
  [!include[](../includes/module-banner.md)] 
  Working with on-premises data sources requires configuring a gateway between Power BI and the on-premises data source. This module examines how to work with gateways and SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) data sources that are used either for scheduled refresh or for live connections. 
abstract: |  
    By the end of this module, you'll be able to: 
    - Understand the difference between gateways, the various connectivity modes, and data refresh methods.
    - Describe the gateway network requirements, where to place the gateway in your network, and how to use clustering to ensure high availability.
    - Scale, monitor, and manage gateway performance and users.
prerequisites: |  
    - Familiarity with Power BI and governance practices in a BI environment. 
    - We recommend that you complete the Admin in a Day, part 1 learning path before beginning this module.
