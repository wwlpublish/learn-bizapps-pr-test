## Export data from a visual
You can also export the data from any visual in the Power BI service. Select the ellipsis on any visual and then select **Export data**. You can save to a Microsoft Excel file or a .CSV file.

When you republish a report in the Power BI service, you're prompted to confirm that you want to replace the previous dataset and reports.

When you select **Replace**, the datasets and reports in the Power BI service are overwritten with the new datasets and reports.
