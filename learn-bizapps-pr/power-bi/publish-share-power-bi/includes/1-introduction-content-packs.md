## Share and collaborate with colleagues in Power BI

Power BI offers various ways of sharing and collaborating with colleagues on your dashboards, reports, and data including:

 - Publish your reports from Power BI Desktop to the Power BI service.
 - Create *Apps* that package a dashboard, report, and dataset to send to your colleagues, who can use the content pack as a starting point and further enhance it.
 - Create *Groups*, which you can use as a security model to identify a subset of users who have access to dashboards, reports, and datasets that you create.
 - Publish to the web so that live reports can be embedded in a webpage.
