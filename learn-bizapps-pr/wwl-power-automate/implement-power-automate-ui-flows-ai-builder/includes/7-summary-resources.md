Business can automate their approval processes, infuse intelligence and integrate their legacy apps in just a fraction of the time, using Power Automate and the new Robotic Process Automation capability alongside AI Builder, which are all part of the Microsoft Power Platform.

Now that you have reviewed this module, you should be able to:

- Create a Power Automate flow to automate routing and approval of an invoice.

- Use AI builder to create a prediction model to automatically parse information from sample invoice documents.

- Implement robotic process automation with UI flows to automate entry of information into a legacy application.

## Key takeaways

Here are the three key takeaways:


- Power Platform is  powerful low code platform that helps you build intelligent, modern apps and experiences around your data and business processes, even as a business user, without being a professional developer or data architect.

- AI Builder is a Power Platform capability that enables you to add intelligence to your automated processes, predict outcomes, and help improve business performance. AI Builder is a turnkey solution that brings the power of Microsoft AI through a point-and-click experience and is directly integrated into Power Apps and Power Automate.

- UI flows bring Robotic Process Automation (RPA) capabilities to Power Automate. You can use UI flows to automate repetitive tasks in Windows and Web applications. UI flows records and plays back user interface actions (clicks, keyboard input, etc.) for applications that don't have easy-to-use or complete APIs available.
