Because controls are designed with specific use cases in mind, the properties for each control are slightly different. Here are some important properties to be aware of:

-   **Default** - The initial value of a control before it is changed by
    the user. For example, when working with a Drop down control you
    could set the default value to appear when users see the control.

-   **DelayOutput** - Set to true to delay action during text input.

-   **DisplayMode** - Values can be **Edit, View,** or **Disabled**.
    Configures whether the control allows user input (**Edit**), only
    displays data (**View**), or is disabled (**Disabled**). For more information about display modes, see Use basic formulas
    to make better canvas apps in Power Apps learning path.

-   **Items** - The source of data that appears in a control such as a
    gallery, list, or chart.

-   **OnChange** - How the app responds when the user changes the value
    of a control. For example, when a user selects a different value in
    a Dropdown control.

-   **OnSelect** - How the app responds when the user taps or clicks a
    control.

-   **Reset** - Whether a control reverts to its default value. For more information, see [Reset function in Power Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/functions/function-reset).

-   **Text** - Text that appears on a control or that the user types into
    a control.

-   **Tooltip** - Explanatory text that appears when the user hovers over
    a control.

-   **Visible** - Whether a control appears or is hidden.
