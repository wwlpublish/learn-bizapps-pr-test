In this exercise scenario, you have been asked to collect telemetry data from the Cost Estimator application. You have decided to use Application Insights to collect and analyze the telemetry data.

## Tasks

The tasks that you will complete in this exercise are:

- Add trace that will track viewed jobs.

- Add trace that will track jobs from validation errors.

## Objectives

The objectives of this exercise are to show you how to:

- Create an Application Insights app in Azure.

- Connect a canvas app to Application Insights.

- Add traces to your application.

- Query trace logs.

## Prerequisites

Make sure that you meet the following prerequisites before beginning the exercise:

- An environment with Microsoft Dataverse installed

- A Microsoft Azure subscription: [Azure - Sign up](https://signup.azure.com/signup?offer=ms-azr-0044p&appId=102&ref=portal&redirectURL=https:%2F%2Fazure.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fget-started%2Fwelcome-to-azure%2F&l=en-us&correlationId=a18965c7a16f4722a855a8e7953047f3)

## Exercise 1: Import a solution
