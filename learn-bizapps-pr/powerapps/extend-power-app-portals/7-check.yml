  - content: You have a requirement to set a default value on table form and also to hide the column. What is the most efficient method to complete the task?
    choices: 
    - content: Use business rules on the model-driven form.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Business rules on the model-driven form will not apply to the portal. A JavaScript function would work, but it is not the most efficient method. Hiding the column on the form designer will not set the default value. An Table Form Metadata record has the ability to set a default value and hide the column by using the CSS class value of "hide."
    - content: Create a JavaScript function.
      isCorrect: false

  - content: You have configured a Power Apps portal on a development environment and you need to move the configuration to your test environment. What tool would you use to accomplish this task?
    choices: 
    - content: Power Apps portals admin center
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: The Power Apps portals admin center does not have tools to migrate portal metadata. Exporting and Importing Excel files would lead to problems with data relationships and potential duplicates of webpages. The Configuration Data Migration tool can use the Portal Schema files to export and import portal metadata. Microsoft Dataverse does not contain portal metadata.

  - content: How would you calculate taxes based on rates that are stored in Dataverse on work orders that were entered on web forms on the portal?
    choices: 
    - content: Add JavaScript to the Web Form steps.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: You would not be able to query the rate information by using JavaScript on the Web Form steps. Creating an external web service would not be the most efficient way to calculate the taxes. A plug-in would launch when the data is saved to Dataverse and can update a tax value based on rates in another table. Dataverse calculated columns can’t pull information (rates) from other records.
    - content: Create an external web application.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: You would not be able to query the rate information by using JavaScript on the Web Form steps.
