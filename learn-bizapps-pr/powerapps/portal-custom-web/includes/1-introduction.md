Liquid is an [open-source template language](http://dotliquidmarkup.org/?azure-portal=true) that can be used to add dynamic content to pages. Liquid code can be used anywhere in the portals where HTML or text content can be entered, including content in webpages, content snippets, and web templates. 

Liquid has various language constructs that can help you build content, apply transformations, and control the implementation flow. Ability to access Common Data Service data by using FetchXML query language or directly retrieving entities by identifiers makes Liquid the primary choice for building data-driven webpages. It also includes a number of special tags (or processing instructions) that specifically target the building of reusable web templates. The following sections explain how templates are used in Microsoft Power Apps portals.

## Templates

In Power Apps portals, the webpage does not define how the page looks when it's rendered on the portal. Instead, it's linked to the **Page Template** record that defines the layout and behavior. 

The two types of templates that you can use in Power Apps portals are:

- **Rewrite** - These templates use server-side processing to implement specialized behavior that is required by some of the components and special pages such as an error page, site map, search, and others. 
- **Web Template** - The linked layout template defines how the content of the page is rendered for output. 

**Rewrite** templates offer limited customizations. Liquid template language can be used as part of the content or inside content snippets, but the page layout and behavior are predefined.

Contrarily, the **Web Template** option is entirely template-based and uses Liquid to define how the content is rendered. Templates are flexible. A template can include other templates for parts of the content. A template can also be based on another template, extending the base functionality. The real power of web templates comes from the ability to contain Liquid code that adds processing capabilities to the static content, including access to Common Data Service data.

> Web templates can also contain HTML, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript.

You can use web templates to define an entire webpage, a part of a page, or common elements such as the site header and footer. This approach creates a consistent appearance and behavior throughout the portal and helps make it easier to modify the appearance and data that is rendered. The following example shows what a typical simple template might look like:

```twig
<div class="container">
  <div class="page-heading">
    {% include 'Breadcrumbs' %}
    {% include 'Page Header' %}
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-12">
    {% block main %}
      {% include 'Page Copy' %}

      {% if page.adx_entitylist %}
        {% include 'entity_list' key:page.adx_entitylist.id %}
      {% endif %}
    
      {% if page.adx_entityform %}
        {% entityform id: page.adx_entityform.id %}
      {% endif %}

		{% endblock %}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

This simple template includes other templates to render common bits and pieces, it defines content block that can be rendered differently by a derived template, and it renders Common Data Service data by using related **Entity List** and **Entity Form** records.

## Web templates as website headers and footers

Web templates can be used to override the global header and footer that is used by a Power Apps portal. To accomplish this task, set the **Header Template** or **Footer Template** field of your website to the web template of your choice.

If you override the **Header Template** field, your selected template assumes responsibility for rendering the primary navigation, sign-in/sign-out links, search interface, and so on, for your site interface elements that are normally handled by the default header template.

> [!TIP]
> If you don't specify a header or a footer template in the **Website** record, the default content is rendered. To remove, specify a blank template.
