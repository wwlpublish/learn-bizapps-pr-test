A portal theme describes the colors, fonts, outlines, and other design elements of a Power Apps portal.

The portal is provisioned with a default theme. However, you might want to align your portal with your specific corporate branding.

## Basic theme

You can turn on the **Enable basic themes** mode to allow makers to change to a prebuilt, preset theme or to create a custom theme by selecting color properties for different aspects of the portal.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Enable basic theme](../media/5-enable-basic-theme-ss.png)](../media/5-enable-basic-theme-ss.png#lightbox)

## Edit CSS

Power Apps portals Studio allows makers to directly edit CSS files that are applied to a portal or to upload a custom CSS file.   

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Edit CSS](../media/5-edit-css-ss.png)](../media/5-edit-css-ss.png#lightbox)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Directly editing the default CSS files with incorrect syntax can lead to undesired results. Additional CSS files can be uploaded and edited to modify the portal appearance. Power Apps portals supports the Bootstrap version 3 framework.
