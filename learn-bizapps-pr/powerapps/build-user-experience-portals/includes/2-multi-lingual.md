Often, organizations need to serve audiences of different languages, or they are required by law to provide multilingual content. A Power Apps portal can deliver content in multiple languages. You can support multiple languages by creating versions of your content structure for each additional language, which helps make it easier to translate and maintain. When a portal user selects a language, they are selecting a specific language version of your content structure.

## Configure additional languages

You can configure additional languages by using the Portal Management app. The **Website** record has a **Supported Languages** section, where you can select the **Add New Website Language** option. When you add a new language to a website, make sure that you select **Portal Language** and **Publishing State**.

> Website language will only allow you to select languages that are already enabled in your Microsoft Power Platform environment. If a language is not visible in the view, the system administrator would need to enable the language in the environment.

## Create language-aware content

You can create language-aware content through localized content on webpages, by providing corresponding web link sets in the language, and by offering language-specific or language-agnostic content snippets.  

### Webpages

Webpages have the concept of localized content pages. The **Localized Content** page is where the actual content of the webpage is created or modified. You can select different templates for each of the content pages, rendering them differently depending on the language.

> [![List of content pages](../media/content-pages-list.png)](../media/content-pages-list.png#lightbox)

However, after you have enabled multiple languages, a single page hierarchy structure will still exist for webpages. In each language of the portal, parent and child pages will have the same relationship, and they will inherit the same security and web files as they would in a single language portal.

### Web link sets

Each supported language of a website should have corresponding web link sets in the language. Web link sets are specific to the chosen language, meaning that the site navigation can vary for different languages of the portal. If a web link set does not exist for a language, the navigation links do not appear in that language.

### Content snippets

Content snippets can be language-specific or language-agnostic. When a content snippet exists with no supported language value, then it will be available in the context of all languages. Language-agnostic snippets are used to deliver content that does not require translation, such as a company logo or JavaScript processing instructions.

Alternatively, if a content snippet has a language value, then the value of the content snippet will only be available when the portal context is in that specific language.

## Browse the multilingual portal

The `MultiLanguage/DisplayLanguageCodeInURL` (true or false) site setting controls whether a language is determined by URL or by each session cookie. When a URL-based approach is selected, the Code property of the portal language will be used as part of the URL `https://portal_url/<code>/page/`, for example, `https://www.contoso.com/en-US/contact-us/`.

## Language considerations

Multilingual design and localization are important considerations for adding portal languages.

### Multilingual design

Certain areas of site design can be affected by the language:

- Text length might vary significantly between the languages, so appropriate space must be reserved.
- Typography elements, such as fonts, might differ and affect the layout rendering.
- Dates and currency are displayed differently depending on locale and the language that is used.
- Some ethical or culturally-sensitive aspects might need to be considered when you are designing site appearance, for example, use of certain images that might be considered offensive by the target audience.

Work with the template designers and use different templates to render the content pages depending on the language.

### Localization

Other than translating the site content and navigation, make sure that you consider the following factors for the multilingual deployment:

- You would need to be disciplined in identifying and localizing every string and phrase that could appear to the site visitor. If you are working with the developers and JavaScript is used, it would involve translation of error messages, status bar messages, alert boxes, dialog boxes, and so on. You should use content snippets extensively because they allow translation of pieces of information, such as an error message, without changing the rest of the site.
- Images for buttons that contain text would also need to be localized. You might create an image map or directory file that lets you find images for the appropriate culture by using a key.
- Communications with portal users need to consider their preferred language (which they can set on their user profile).
- If your Common Data Service is customized, ensure that all custom entities, fields, option sets, messages, and descriptions are translated.
- If your deployment uses other solutions, work with vendors to ensure that their solutions are localized into required languages.
- For deployments that use knowledge articles, ensure that the relevant articles are translated or, at least, create placeholders that direct visitors to the base language versions where they can use browser-based translation tools such as [Bing Translate](https://www.bing.com/translator/?azure-portal=true).
