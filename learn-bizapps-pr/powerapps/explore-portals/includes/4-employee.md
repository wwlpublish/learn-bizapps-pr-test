# Employee self-service portal

The Employee self-service template provides organizations with a portal that is configured to assist employees with finding specific human resources and company information or for resolving employee-specific issues.

> [!NOTE]
> The Employee self-service portal is only available on Common Data Service environments with Dynamics 365 apps enabled.

By default, the Employee self-service portal is configured to authenticate by using Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), which provides employees with a single sign-on experience.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Organizations are required to have at least a Dynamics 365 Team license subscription for each employee who accesses the Employee self-service portal. For more information, see the [Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=866544).

The Employee self-service portal provides employees with the following features:

- Knowledge articles
- Forums
- Support cases

## Knowledge articles

The **Knowledge Article** feature of the Employee self-service portal operates as described for the Community portal. However, this feature is geared more toward supporting employees rather than customers.

Employees can search for knowledge articles that cover various human resources or corporate policies and procedures on a portal.

This search would also require the internal department (for example, a Human Resource team) to use the Dynamics 365 Customer Service Hub app to manage and maintain applicable knowledge articles.

## Forums

The **Forum** functionality in the Employee self-service portal operates the same way as it does for the Community and Customer self-service portals. However, the discussions would typically be available to internal staff only and would follow topics that are related to Employee self-service.

## Support cases

The **Support Cases** functionality is the same as described in the Community and Customer self-service portals. For the Employee self-service portal, the customers would represent internal employees of an organization.

This factor would require that the internal department is contacted for support (for example, a Human Resources or internal IT team), and that they use the Dynamics 365 Customer Service Hub app to monitor and respond to support cases from employees.
