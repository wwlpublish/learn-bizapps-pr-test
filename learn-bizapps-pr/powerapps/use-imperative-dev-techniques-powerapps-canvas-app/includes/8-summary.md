In this module, you learned about variables in Power Apps and how they
enable you to apply both imperative and declarative programming
techniques.

Here are some key concepts to remember:

-   Power Apps supports both imperative and declarative logic.

-   Global variables are for storing information to use throughout your
    app.

-   Context variables are for storing information that is only available
    on the same screen.

-   Collections are a type of variable that stores table data. Most
    table functions and controls work with collections like all tabular
    data sources.
