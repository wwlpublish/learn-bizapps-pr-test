Solution architects are responsible for the overall high-level design of the data model for the solution. It is imperative that solution architects understand the capabilities of Microsoft Dataverse when they are designing the data model for the solution. This module addresses the tradeoffs for modeling data in Microsoft Power Platform solutions.

## Data modeling overview

A data model is a visual model that shows how data flows through your system and how different entities relate to each other. Data models define the relationship types between entities and abstract a database to a straightforward visual representation.

For solutions that are based on Microsoft Power Platform, the data model is crucial to the design of the solution because it will affect app design, especially model-driven apps.

## Solution architect’s role in data modeling

With data modeling, the solution architect's role is to:

- Lead the data model design effort to establish a high-level data architecture for the project.
- Establish a data model that can be extended by the individual design teams and communicate the design with the teams.
- Review and provide feedback as the data model evolves during detail design of solution features.

## Work with multiple options

Data modeling can be difficult, and having experience with many different projects will increase your data modeling skills. Often, a clear correct answer won't be provided, and many possible options might be available.

Solution architects need to make the best choices with the limited information that is available, which is part of being a solution architect.
