The ability to find and interact with Common Data Service data is one of the core benefits of implementing a Power Apps portal. Entity lists, entity forms, and web forms are configurable to enable access to Common Data Service data in portals and turn content portals into functional web apps. They are configurable and extendable to satisfy the most demanding business requirements.

To review, this module covered the following topics:

* The available portal components that can help you find and interact with Common Data Service data on the portal.
* Various features of the portal components.
* Configuring entity form and web form metadata to access individual records.
* Displaying a list of data and an associated drill-down list for details.
* Planning and configuring a web form to implement a business process on a portal.
* Triggering classic Common Data Service workflows from the portal.

## Next steps

The next step in exploring the portal's capabilities is to study the inner workings of web templates and advanced Liquid constructs that can help in building robust and flexible webpages.
