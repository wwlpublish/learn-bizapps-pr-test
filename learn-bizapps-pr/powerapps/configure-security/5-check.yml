    choices: 
    - content: Contact scope
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Use Account scope and then specify parent account relationship.

  - content: You added a Dynamic Lookup Filter to your entity list so that you can filter the list by currency. However, at runtime, the list of available currencies in the filter is empty. You double-checked your Common Data Service instance, which shows that active currency records do exist. What do you need to do to display currencies in the filter?
    choices: 
    - content: Remove and then add the filter again
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Whenever Common Data Service data is accessed by using methods other than Entity List or Entity Form, entity permissions are applied automatically, including metadata filters where the Dynamic Lookup Filter is used. For an entity to display lookup values, an entity permission record is required.

  - content: You have a product list page that uses an entity list to display the data. You have configured Read  permissions for the product list entity and have set the scope to Global. Users have complained that they can browse a product listing page anonymously but are denied access to the page after they sign in. How would you resolve the issue?
    choices: 
    - content: Change the scope to Contact
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: One of the web roles in the portal can be marked as Anonymous and another one as Authenticated. These roles allow you to apply permissions and access rules to all portal users based on whether they access the site anonymously or if they are signed in. Because users can access the data anonymously but can’t when they’re authenticated, it indicates that the entity permission is associated with the Anonymous role but not with the Authenticated one.
