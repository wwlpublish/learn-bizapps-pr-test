The purpose of this hands-on lab is to configure table permissions to secure access to Microsoft Dataverse rows.

The exercises work best when you have sample data to work with. Depending on the environment that you are working with, you might want to install some sample data to assist with the exercises. Microsoft Power Platform does provide the ability to add sample data as needed. If the environment that you are working in does not have sample data installed, follow the steps in the [Add or remove sample data](/power-platform/admin/add-remove-sample-data/?azure-portal=true) documentation to install the sample data into your environment.

## Learning objectives

At the end of these exercises, you will be able to:

- Open the Power Apps portals Studio to configure a table list to use table permissions.
- Create and assign a web role.
- Create a table permission row.
- Link the table permission to the web role and associate the web role to a Dataverse contact.

### Prerequisites

For this exercise, you will need to have the following parameters set up in your environment:

- A Power Apps portal that is provisioned. If you do not have a Power Apps portal available, follow the [Create Portal](/powerapps/maker/portals/create-portal/?azure-portal=true) instructions to create one.

- Access to the Power Apps maker portal.

## Scenario

Your organization has provisioned a Power Apps portal and wants to create a directory of partner organizations. After initial provisioning of the portal pages and the table lists to manage the partner directory, administrators have discovered that access to the data has not been restricted, as initially planned, and that the directory is publicly available.

The company wants to restrict access to the data to authenticated users only.

### High-level steps

To finish the exercise, complete the following tasks:

- Add a webpage with a list component that shows the account table.
- Enable **table Permissions** to restrict the viewing of accounts to authenticated users only.
- Register a new user on the portal by using local authentication.
- Create a **Web Role** row.
- Create an **table Permission** row, providing global read access to the accounts table.
- Link the portal user to the web role and link the web role to the table permission.
- Confirm that the authenticated user has access to the list of accounts.
