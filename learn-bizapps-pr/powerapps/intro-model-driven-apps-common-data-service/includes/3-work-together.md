When creating a model-driven app, you can use entities from Common Data Service
as your building blocks. Model-driven apps start with your
data model, building up from the shape of your core business data and
processes in Common Data Service to model forms, views, and other
components. 

It's important to ensure that your business data and business 
processes at the data level are structured properly before you 
compose your app. Model-driven apps will automatically generate a
UI that is responsive across devices; however, this outcome 
relies heavily on how your data is modeled in Common Data Service.

## Approach to model-driven app making

When creating model-driven apps, it's important to focus on three areas:

- Modeling business data
- Defining business processes
- Composing the app.

More information on this is included in the Create relationships, business rules, calculations, and rollups in Common Data Service Learning Path and in [Overview of building model-driven apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-overview).
