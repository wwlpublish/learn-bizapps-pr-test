Whether you are building a canvas app or a model-driven app, Common
Data Service is the ideal data source because it is
the foundational data source of Power Platform. As a result, you will
experience the most functionality, the deepest integrations, the most features,
and the best ease-of-use of any available data sources. From
simple web-based data design to robust, role-based security, 
Common Data Service is a straightforward platform that you can use to begin designing your
data structures and helping to keep them safe. Then, with your data in place, you
have rich integration capabilities from Power Apps and the rest of 
Power Platform. Additionally, by applying business rules, you can trust that your
business integrity will be maintained no matter what tool you use to
interact with the data.

Another benefit of using Common Data Service is that all
of your data is stored in entities. An entity is a set of records that is used
to store data, similar to how a table stores data within a database.
Common Data Service includes a base set of standard entities that cover
typical scenarios, but you can also create custom entities that are specific to
your organization. Standard and custom entities within Common Data
Service help provide a secure and cloud-based storage option for your data.
Entities allow you create a business-focused definition of your
organization's data for use within apps. 

Some benefits of using Common Data Service and its entities include:

-   **Simple to manage** - Both the metadata and data are stored in the
    cloud so that you're confident about the details of how they're
    stored.

-   **Helps secure your data** - Data is stored so that users can see
    it only if you grant them access. Role-based security allows you to
    control access to entities for different users within your
    organization.

-   **Access your Dynamics 365 data** - If you use Dynamics 365, data 
    from your Dynamics 365 application is also stored within Common Data 
    Service, allowing you to quickly build apps that use your 
    Dynamics 365 data and extend your apps by using Power Apps.

-   **Rich metadata** - Data types and relationships are used
    directly within Power Apps.

-   **Logic and validation** - Define calculated fields, business
    rules, workflows, and business process flows to ensure data quality
    and drive business processes.

-   **Productivity tools** - Entities are available within the add-ins
    for Microsoft Excel to increase productivity and ensure data
    accessibility.

Now that you have a better understanding of how Common Data Service works and
are aware of some of the benefits, you can now explore how these can be applied 
in a model-driven app.
