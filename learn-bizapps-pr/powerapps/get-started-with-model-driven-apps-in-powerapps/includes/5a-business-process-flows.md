You can help ensure that people enter data consistently and follow the 
same steps every time they work with a customer by creating a business 
process flow. 

For example, you might want to create a business process flow to have 
everyone handle customer service requests the same way, or to require 
that people get approval for an invoice before submitting an order. 
Business process flows use the same underlying technology as other 
processes, but the capabilities that they provide are very different 
from other features that use processes. To learn how to create or edit 
a business process flow, see [Create a business process flow](/power-automate/create-business-process-flow)

## Use business process flows
Why should you use business process flows? Business process flows provide 
a guide for people to get work done. They provide a streamlined user 
experience that leads people through the processes their organization has 
defined for interactions that need to be advanced to a conclusion of some kind. 
This user experience can be tailored so that people with different security 
roles can have an experience that best suits the work they do.

You should use business process flows to define a set of steps for people to 
follow to take them to a desired outcome. These steps provide a visual indicator 
that tells people where they are in the business process. 

Business process flows reduce the need for training because new users don’t have 
to focus on which table they should be using. They can let the process guide them. 
You can configure business process flows to support common sales methodologies that 
can help your sales groups achieve better results. 

For service groups, business process flows can help new staff get up to speed more 
quickly and avoid mistakes that could result in unsatisfied customers.

### System business process flows
The following business process flows can be found in Power Automate. To understand 
how business process flows work, review these system business process flows:

- Lead to Opportunity Sales Process
- Opportunity Sales Process
- Phone to Case Process 

### Multiple tables in business process flows
You can use a business process flow for a single table or to span multiple tables. 
For example, you may have a process that begins with an opportunity, then continues 
to a quote, an order, and then an invoice, before finally returning to close the 
opportunity.

You can design business process flows that tie together the rows for up to five 
different tables into a single process so that people using the app can focus on 
the flow of their process rather than on which table they are working in. This way, 
they can easily navigate between related table rows.

### Multiple business process flows are available per table
Not every user in an organization may follow the same process and different conditions 
may require that a different process be applied. You can have up to 10 active business 
process flows per table to provide appropriate processes for different situations.
