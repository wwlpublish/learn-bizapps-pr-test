In this module, you learned about security modeling with Microsoft Power Platform, including:

- Different aspects of security architecture.
- Securing environments.
- Security features of Microsoft Dataverse.
- The impact of security on performance.
- Modeling different usage scenarios.

Security must be considered from the start of the project. The solution architect must ensure that security is designed into the data and app models. Changing security later in the process, after the data model has been created and apps have been composed, can be difficult. Security modeling is unique to each solution; one size doesn't fit all.

Different industries and business models follow different approaches to granting access. The solution architect should look for common patterns that emerge from requirements. Often, these patterns emerge from how the relationships with the stakeholders of the system are managed.

Primarily, solution architects should keep security as simple as possible, while still meeting the business needs, to secure data and optimize the user experience.
