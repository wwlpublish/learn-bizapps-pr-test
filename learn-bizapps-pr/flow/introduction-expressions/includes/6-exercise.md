Let's say you need to find out how much it would cost to carpet a room based on its square footage. In this exercise, you'll create a manual flow that will use your input to do those calculations.

1. Sign into [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/?azure-portal=true).

1. Create a new Instant cloud flow.

1. Name it **CalculateFlow** and select **Manually trigger a flow**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > [![Screenshot of select manually trigger a flow.](../media/manually-trigger-flow-ss.png)](../media/manually-trigger-flow-ss.png#lightbox)

1. Select the **Manually trigger a flow** step and select **Add an input**.

1. Choose **Number** and name it **Square Footage**.

1. Select **Add an input** and choose **Number** again and name it **Cost**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > [![Screenshot of choose Number and name it Cost.](../media/cost-ss.png)](../media/cost-ss.png#lightbox)

1. Select **New Step** and search for and select the **Compose** action.

1. Select the **Inputs** box and the Dynamic content window will appear.

1. Select the Expression tab and type in **mul(**. Power Automate will know that you're using the multiply expression and automatically add a **)** at the end for you.

1. With your cursor still between the two parentheses in the expression field, select the **Dynamic content** tab.

1. Select **Square Footage** in the dynamic content below.

1. Next add a comma (,) and choose **Cost** in the dynamic content below.

1. The complete expression should be:

   ```regex
   mul(triggerBody()['number'],triggerBody()['number_1'])
    ```

1. Select **OK** to add the expression into the Compose step.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > [![Screenshot of add the expression into the Compose step.](../media/add-expression-ss.png)](../media/add-expression-ss.png#lightbox)

1. You'll know your expression is correct if it's added into the Compose step and looks like:

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > [![Screenshot of add expression into Compose step.](../media/correct-expression-ss.png)](../media/correct-expression-ss.png#lightbox)

   This compose step is now doing the math of calculating the square footage of the area multiplied by the cost per square foot based upon inputs you'll provide. However, we still need to convert the final result to currency to get the correct answer.

1. Select **New Step** and search for and select the **Compose** action again.

1. Select the **Inputs** box and again the Dynamic content window will appear.

1. Select the Expressions tab and type in **FormatNumber(**.

1. With your cursor in place, select the **Dynamic content** tab and choose **Outputs** from the preview Compose step.

1. Next finish the expression with **, 'C2'**.

    The C formats the number as currency, with the 2 representing how many decimal places. Refer to [Standard numeric format strings](/dotnet/standard/base-types/standard-numeric-format-strings/?azure-portal=true) for more number formats.

1. The complete expression is:

   ```regex
   formatNumber(outputs('Compose'), 'C2')
    ```

1. Select **OK** to add this expression in the Compose 2 step.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > [![Screenshot of add expression to Compose 2 step.](../media/add-expression-compose-ss.png)](../media/add-expression-compose-ss.png#lightbox)

   Now after our flow is triggered, it first multiplies the two numbers, then converts the result into the correct currency format. This gives you a quick way to get the cost associated with carpeting a room.

1. Your complete flow will look like this:

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > [![Screenshot of completed flow with Manually trigger a flow, Compose, and Compose 2.](../media/complete-flow-ss.png)](../media/complete-flow-ss.png#lightbox)

1. In the top-right corner, select the **Save** button, then select **Test**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > [![Screenshot of Save and Test buttons](../media/save-test-ss.png)](../media/save-test-ss.png#lightbox)

1. Choose **I'll perform the trigger action** and then select **Test**.

1. Enter the two number inputs, **Square Footage** and **Cost**, and then select **Run flow** at the bottom.

1. The page will reload and you'll see green check marks next to each step of your flow.

1. Selecting each step will expand the details showing you the inputs and outputs of each step.

1. Selecting Compose will show the multiplied value of the two numbers you entered, while selecting Compose 2 will show the currency format of that multiplied value.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > [![Screenshot of Compose showing the multiplied value, and Compose 2 showing the currency value.](../media/value-ss.png)](../media/value-ss.png#lightbox)

Let's recap what we've done.

**Manually trigger a flow** - Allows us to press a button to trigger a flow and provide inputs. In this case our two inputs are *Square Footage* and *Cost*, which we're using to find out the total price to carpet a room.

**Compose** - We use this to write expressions using the data from elsewhere in the flow. In this case, we first multiplied the two inputs from the trigger. This gave us the correct number, but we still needed to convert it to currency. We then used another compose action to format the multiplied result into currency. This gives us the answer to how much it would cost to carpet a room.
