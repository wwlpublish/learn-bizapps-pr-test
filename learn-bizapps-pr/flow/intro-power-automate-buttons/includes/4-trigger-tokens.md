Trigger tokens are data points that are known and available to the
device on which the button flow is running. These tokens are dependent
on factors such as time and the geographic location of the device at a
given moment.

When you run a flow from a virtual button on a smart phone, the date,
time, and the current address where the phone is located are
automatically available for use. You can use these trigger tokens to
build useful flows that will minimize repetitive tasks such as providing
your location to someone or tracking how much time you spent on a
particular job or service call.

The following list describes the button trigger tokens that are available for
you to use when creating your button flows.
