Microsoft Power Automate buttons are the app-based virtual buttons that
provide you with the flexibility to automate repetitive tasks with just a tap
of a button, from any place and at any time, through your mobile device. 

Implementing Power Automate buttons saves you time and, because the tasks 
that they perform are automated, it results in fewer errors than if you 
manually performed the tasks.
