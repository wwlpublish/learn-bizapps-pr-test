Planning is essential in helping to secure and govern your Microsoft Power Platform environments. Because Microsoft Power Platform contains democratized tools that can be used by many different people, teams, business 
units, and roles in an organization, minimizing disruptions to those app 
makers will ensure that your organization remains productive and that a 
disruption to business-critical processes doesn't occur. Introducing governance 
changes after apps and flows have been built might result in those apps and flows being broken, 
leading to unmet expectations.

If Microsoft Power Platform is new to your organization, now is the best
opportunity to get ahead before any potential impacts are introduced. If
your organization already uses Microsoft Power Platform, you should 
establish a solid plan that allows you to be prepared for the future and avoid
unnecessary disruptions.
