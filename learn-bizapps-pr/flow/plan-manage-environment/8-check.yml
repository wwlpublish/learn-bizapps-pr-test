  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned. 
  questions: 
  - content: By using automation, what is your best way to communicate Power Platform policies?
    choices: 
    - content: Send makers an email when they have built their first flow or app by using Power Platform Management connectors and Power Automate.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: No in-product experience exists to help you communicate policies within Power Automate. However, administrators can use Power Automate and Power Platform Management connectors to build flows that detect when a user creates a flow for the first time and then send them an email that includes policy information.
    - content: Display policy information in the Admin Analytics reports in the Power Platform Admin Center.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: No in-product experience exists to help you communicate policies within Power Automate. However, administrators can use Power Automate and Power Platform Management connectors to build flows that detect when a user creates a flow for the first time and then send them an email that includes policy information.
    - content: Display policy information in the Power Automate maker portal.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: No in-product experience exists to help you communicate policies within Power Automate. However, administrators can use Power Automate and Power Platform Management connectors to build flows that detect when a user creates a flow for the first time and then send them an email that includes policy information.
    - content: Update the terms and conditions statements in the Power Platform Admin Center.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: No in-product experience exists to help you communicate policies within Power Automate. However, administrators can use Power Automate and Power Platform Management connectors to build flows that detect when a user creates a flow for the first time and then send them an email that includes policy information.
  - content: Suppose you have two Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies. Within policy one is the Microsoft Teams connector and the Office 365 Users connector in the Business data only data group. Policy two contains the SharePoint and Office 365 Groups connectors in the Business data only data group. What happens if you try to create a flow that includes Microsoft Teams and SharePoint connectors within the same flow?
    choices: 
    - content: The flow is successfully saved and remains in an enabled state.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Because SharePoint and Microsoft Teams connectors appear in two different Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies, they cannot be included within the same flow because it will conflict with DLP policies. The default behavior of DLP policy enforcement is that, when saving, DLP rules will be checked. If a flow violates a DLP policy, it will still be saved but will be in a disabled state.
    - content: The flow is successfully saved, runs for 30 minutes, and then is disabled.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Because SharePoint and Microsoft Teams connectors appear in two different Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies, they cannot be included within the same flow because it will conflict with DLP policies. The default behavior of DLP policy enforcement is that, when saving, DLP rules will be checked. If a flow violates a DLP policy, it will still be saved but will be in a disabled state.
    - content: The flow is successfully saved but is immediately disabled due to a DLP violation.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Because SharePoint and Microsoft Teams connectors appear in two different Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies, they cannot be included within the same flow because it will conflict with DLP policies. The default behavior of DLP policy enforcement is that, when saving, DLP rules will be checked. If a flow violates a DLP policy, it will still be saved but will be in a disabled state.
    - content: The flow is not successfully saved, and the maker will lose all of their work.

Policy two contains the SharePoint and Office 365 Groups connectors in the Business data only data group. What happens if you try to create a flow that includes Common Data Service and Twitter connectors within the same flow?
    choices: 
    - content: The flow is successfully saved and remains in an enabled state.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Because the Common Data Service and Twitter connectors have not been explicitly placed in the Business data only data groups in each DLP policy, these connectors remain in the No business data allowed data group. When connectors exist in the same data group, a flow or app can be created that uses these connectors. In this scenario, because no policy exists that blocks using these connectors, you can still create a flow that uses connectors from the same data group, even if it is from the No business data allowed data group.
