  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned. 
  questions: 
  - content: You have created a custom connector and want another user in the same environment to use it to create a Power Automate flow. What do you need to do to allow this accessibility?
    choices: 
    - content: Select the Save as option on the custom connector to create a copy for the other user.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Sharing the custom connector would allow the other person to use it without having to make a copy.
    - content: Share the custom connector with the other user.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: By default, custom connectors aren't available to other users; you must share them to make them available to others.
    - content: Change the authentication type to anonymous.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: The authentication type does not have bearing on whether another user can use the connector. By default, connectors aren't available to other users; you have to share them directly so that they can create a connection and build apps or a flow.
    - content: Add the connector to a solution and then publish it.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Connectors can be included as a component of a solution. However, they still need to be shared to be available to the other users.
  - content: Which authentication scheme is recommended to help secure custom connectors to the API that is deployed by using Azure Functions?
    choices: 
    - content: No authentication
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: No authentication scheme allows any anonymous user to use a custom connector.
    - content: Basic authentication
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Basic authentication is a valid authentication scheme, but it is not a recommended one to use within the Azure Active Directory environment.
    - content: Azure Active Directory OAuth 2.0 identity provider
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: OAuth 2.0 authentication scheme with Azure AD provider is the recommended security scheme.
    - content: Windows authentication
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Windows authentication is only available for custom connectors by using an on-premises connector.
  - content: Which one of the following authentication types is not supported by custom connectors?
    choices: 
    - content: Basic
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Basic authentication is supported by custom connectors.
    - content: Cookies
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Cookies authentication is not supported by custom connectors.
    - content: API Key
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: API Key authentication is supported by custom connectors.
    - content: OAuth 2.0
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: OAuth 2.0 authentication is supported by custom connectors.
  - content: When you are configuring OAuth 2.0 authentication for a custom connector, which of the following properties must you retrieve from the API identity provider to complete the security configuration?
    choices: 
    - content: API Key
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: An API key is only required when you are using API authentication for the custom connector. You must have a client ID and client secret from the identity provider of the API that you're using to configure a custom connector for OAuth 2.0.
    - content: Client ID and Client secret
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: The client ID and client secret are provided when the app for custom connector is registered with the identity provider. They are required to configure a custom connector to use OAuth 2.0 authentication.
    - content: User and password
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: This is only required for Basic authentication. You must have a client ID and client secret from the identity provider of the API that you're using to configure a custom connector for OAuth 2.0.
    - content: A public key
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: You must have a client ID and client secret from the identity provider of the API that you're using to configure a custom connector for OAuth 2.0.
