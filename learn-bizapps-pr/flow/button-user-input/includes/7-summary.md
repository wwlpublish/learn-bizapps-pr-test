Having a flow button to trigger flows that require user input is simple 
and effective. You can use six different types of inputs in your 
flows: **Text**, **Yes/No**, **File**, **Email**, **Number**, and **Date**.

These inputs allow you to capture information from the user to then use
in the flow and run differently depending on the inputs made. This module 
explained how to implement flows that require user input, and how flows can directly 
integrate with features of Microsoft Outlook such as Out of Office and Tasks.
