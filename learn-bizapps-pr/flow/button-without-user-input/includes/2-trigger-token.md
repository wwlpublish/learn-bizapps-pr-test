Trigger tokens are data points that are known and available to the
device on which the button flow is running. These tokens are dependent
on factors such as time and the geographic location of the device at a
given moment.

When you run a flow from a button on a smart phone, the date,
time, and current address where the phone is located are
automatically available for use. You can use these trigger tokens to
build useful flows that will minimize repetitive tasks such as providing
your location to someone or tracking how much time that you have spent on a
particular job/service call.

The following table provides a list of button trigger tokens that are available for
you to use when creating your button flows.
