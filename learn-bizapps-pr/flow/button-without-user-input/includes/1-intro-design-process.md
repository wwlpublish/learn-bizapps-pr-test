Building a Button flow is the same as building any other flow. You have a start and an end. A flow always starts with a trigger action and in this module, we are focusing on Manually triggering a flow using buttons without any input.

- After the trigger you add steps.  

- Each step can be an action or a condition or a combination of actions and conditions.  

- The flow always ends with an action.

There are two ways to design the process for a Button Flow. One is to use an existing template with a button trigger, and the other is to build one from blank.  

### Existing template

Using an existing template is a great way to understand the basic
principles to design a successful flow.

To build a flow using an existing template, follow these steps:

1. [Sign in to Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/?azure-portal=true).

1. On the left navigation pane, select **Templates**.

1. In the search bar on the top, in **Search templates**, enter **Buttons**.

1. Select a template that matches your requirements, add your connectors,
    and then fill in the required parameters.

The following screenshot shows an example of the button templates.

### Build a flow from blank

Building a flow from blank allows you the flexibility to design a
workflow that matches your
requirements through customized logic.

To build a flow from blank, follow these steps:

1. [Sign in to Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/?azure-portal=true).

1. On the left navigation pane, select **+ Create**.

1. The page shows different ways for you to make a flow. Select **Instant flow**.

1. Give your flow a name. In the **Choose how to trigger this flow** section, select
    **Manually trigger a flow**.

1. Select **Create** to start building the flow.
