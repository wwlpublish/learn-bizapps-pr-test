    - content: "Loop"
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: "That is correct! The loop action is ideal for a known number of repetitions."
    - content: "For Each"
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: "That is false; the loop action is ideal for a known number of repetitions."
    - content: "Any of the above"
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: "That is false; the loop action is ideal for a known number of repetitions."
  - content: "The elements of which data types can be accessed through a For Each loop?"
    choices:

  - content: "What is the difference between a Loop and a For Each loop?"
    choices: 
    - content: "For Each loops iterate through a list of items, while Loops iterate for a set number of repetitions."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Loops iterate for a set number of repetitions."
    - content: "For Each loops iterate through a list of items, while Loops iterate until a condition is met."
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: "Loops iterate for a set number of repetitions."
