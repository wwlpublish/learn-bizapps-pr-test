title: Automate repetitive tasks using loops in Power Automate Desktop
summary: |  
  [!include[](../includes/module-banner.md)] 
  Loops are used to automate repetitive tasks by executing a block of actions multiple times.
abstract: |  
    In this module, you will: 
    - Use simple loops to perform a given number of repetitions and iterate through data
    - Deploy loop conditions in order to repeat actions until a condition is met
    - Iterate through the items of a list using for each loops
    - Explicitly end loops when required
prerequisites: |
    A basic understanding of [how to use Power Automate Desktop Console and Flow designer](../pad-first-steps/index.yml), and [how to handle list and data table variables](../pad-variables/index.yml).
