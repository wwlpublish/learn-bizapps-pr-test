Only individuals with whom the button flow is shared can use
the button flow. The button flow maker has the option to view the 
list of users with whom the button has been shared. 

To find the list of users, follow these steps:

1.  Sign in to the Power Automate mobile app and then select the **Buttons** 
	icon on the lower horizontal menu.

1.  Select the ellipsis (**...**) next to the flow button 
	and then select **Invite others**.

1.  In the **Shared with** section, you will see the list of that button 
	flow's users.
