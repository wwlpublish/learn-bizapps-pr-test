All flows, including button flows, use connections. The security of
connections can be viewed through a flow or the connector. You can view all 
the connectors that are used from a flow. From a connector, you can view all
the flows that use that connector.

The following screenshot shows all connectors that are used for the SMS button flow.

You can see all connectors from the mobile Power Automate app as well.

To view all apps that use a connector, sign in to Power Automate from a
browser. Select **Settings** on the upper right portion of the
screen and then select **Connections**. Select any connector and then
select **Flows using this connection** to see all flows that use that connector.

The flow **Details** screen shows other important information such as the owner of
the connection and when it was created and modified.

When you are sharing ownership of the
flow button, you are also giving full access to all of the connections that are  
used in the flow and the contents within the connected accounts. 

Owners are not required to add connections to their own accounts. Thus,
you should only add owners to a flow if you want to share full access 
to all connections in the flow. If you want to have someone else 
edit a flow offline without granting access to connections, you can 
export the flow.

If you are giving run-only access, then the flow connections will
provide run-only access to this flow. These users won't be able to
access the connections outside of this flow.
