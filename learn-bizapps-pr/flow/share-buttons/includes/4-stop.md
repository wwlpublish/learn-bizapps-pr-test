To stop sharing a button flow that was originally built by you, follow these steps:

1.  Sign in to your Power Automate mobile app and then select the **Buttons** icon 
    on the lower horizontal menu.

1.  Select the ellipsis (**...**) next to the flow button and then select **Invite Others**.

1.  Select each of the users with whom the button has been shared. To stop 
    sharing, select each of the users and then select **Remove user**.

When you return to the button flow, you will no longer see the user(s) 
that you removed from the **Shared with** list.
