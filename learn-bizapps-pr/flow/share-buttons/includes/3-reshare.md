You can share a button flow that has been shared with you.
Consider a scenario where a button flow was built by the maker, in this case 
Diego Sicillani, and was shared with another user, in this case Lee Gu. 

As Lee Gu, you will share the button flow with others by following these steps:

1.  Sign in to the **Power Automate** mobile app and select **Buttons** 
    on the lower horizontal menu.

1.  Select the ellipsis (**...**) next to the flow button and then select **Share button link**.

1.  You will be provided with a few options to share the button link. For this example, 
    select **Mail** and share the app with another user who is 
    part of the same Office 365 tenant. In this case, you are sharing 
    the link with Pradeep who is the receiving user.

1.  When the receiving user, Pradeep, selects the text message, 
    the Power Automate mobile app will automatically open and 
    Pradeep will have access to the app. Depending on how the flow was 
    built, Pradeep might need to approve the connectors.

You have now successfully shared the button link of a button flow
that was shared with you.
