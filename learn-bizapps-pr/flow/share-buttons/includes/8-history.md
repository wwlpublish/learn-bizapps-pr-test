To monitor the run history of a button flow, you need to look at the flow
history. You can view a flow's history from a computer browser or
from the Power Automate mobile app. 

The flow name and the button name are the same. To view the history from the Power Automate mobile app, follow these steps:

1.  Sign in to your Power Automate mobile app and then select the **Buttons** 
    icon on the lower horizontal menu. Note the button name of the 
    flow history that you want to view.

2.  Select the Flows icon on the lower horizontal 
    menu. Find the flow that you want to view history for and then select it.

3.  In the **Flow details** section, locate and select **Run history**.

    You can see all the flow runs, both successful and unsuccessful.

4.  Select each of the runs and view the details.

Viewing the history for a flow can help you determine if people are having difficulty 
with your button flow and possibly help troubleshoot any issues that users are 
experiencing with your button flow.
