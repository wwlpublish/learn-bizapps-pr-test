You have now successfully completed this module and learned how to
correctly and securely share a flow button. In addition, you 
learned how the connectors work and what options are available 
for both a maker and an end user to share button flows.

You can monitor the run history of a button flow, by looking at 
the flow history. You can view the history for a flow and it can 
help you evaluate if people are having difficulty using your button 
flow, and it can possibly help you troubleshoot any issues that 
your flow's users are experiencing.

You can reshare a button flow, stop sharing a flow, and view a list
of users who have access to your button flow. Finally, you can share flow 
buttons from Power Automate on your computer, or use the mobile app.
