You can remove a button flow that was shared with you. This process might
be necessary because you no longer need to use the flow and want 
to remove it from your mobile device. 

To remove a button flow, follow these steps:

1.  Sign in to the Power Automate mobile app and then select 
    the **Buttons** icon on the lower horizontal menu.

1.  Select the ellipsis (**...**) next to the flow button and then select **Remove**.

The shared button will no longer be available.

You can get the button back if the maker
still has it shared with you. To get the button back, select the 
**Buttons** icon on the lower horizontal menu. 
Select **Get more** on the upper right of the app screen. 
You should see the button that you just deleted.
