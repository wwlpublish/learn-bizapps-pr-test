In this exercise, you'll use CLI to download a connector, validate the definition, and resolve issues. This exercise simulates what you would do to prepare for creating and certifying an open-source custom connector.

This exercise requires you to install Python and access the command prompt on the machine that you're using for the exercise.

> [!Important]
> Use a test environment with Microsoft Dataverse provisioned. If you do not have one, you can sign up for the **[community plan](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/communityplan/?azure-portal=true)**.

> [!NOTE]
> Download the following file to your local computer to complete this exercise [Contoso Invoicing Triggers](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-developer-tools-power-platform/blob/master/power-automate-connectors/certify/ContosoInvoicingOpenSource_1_0_0_0.zip). Select the download button on the middle-right of the screen.

## Task 1: Import the solution

In this task, you'll import an unmanaged solution that contains a Contoso Invoicing custom connector. You'll use this connector to complete the tasks in this exercise.

1. Go to [Power Apps maker portal](https://make.powerapps.com/?azure-portal=true) and make sure that you are in the correct environment.

1. Select **Solutions > Import**.

1. Select **Browse**.

1. Select the **ContosoInvoicingOpenSource_1_0_0_0.zip** solution and then select **Open**.

1. Select **Next**.

1. Select **Import** and then wait for the import to complete. You should get a success message after the import completes.

1. Select the **Contoso Invoicing - Open Source** solution that you imported.

   You should see the **Contoso Invoicing - Open Source** custom connector component.

   > [![Screenshot of the command prompt showing the install paconn command.](../media/3-03-install-paconn.png)](../media/3-03-install-paconn.png#lightbox)

1. Wait for the installation to complete.

## Task 3: Download the connector locally

In this task, you'll download the connector definition files locally so that you can add the Host URL property.

1. Run the login command.

   `paconn login`

1. Copy the provided **Code**.

   `paconn download`

1. When prompted to select an environment, enter a number for the environment where you installed the solution and then press the **Enter** key.

1. Provide the number of the **Contoso Invoicing - Open Source** connector and then press the **Enter** key.

1. The download should complete successfully. Note the location where the connector was downloaded.

## Task 4: Validate

In this task, you'll validate the connector and fix some common errors. You'll also add the required connector metadata.

1. Copy the path where the connector was downloaded.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > [![Screenshot of the connector path selected in the command window.](../media/3-06-connector-path.png)](../media/3-06-connector-path.png#lightbox)

1. Run the validate command by using the path that you copied plus the API definition Swagger file name **\apiDefinition.swagger.json**.

   `paconn validate --api-def [Path to apiDefinition.swagger.json]`

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > [![Screenshot of the validate command in the command window.](../media/3-07-validate-command.png)](../media/3-07-validate-command.png#lightbox)

1. You should get an error for a missing summary for the fourth parameter of the ListInvoices action and a missing contact property.

1. Wait for the connector update to complete.

1. Delete the connector that you previously downloaded (you will re-add it in a moment). Delete the connector that you downloaded from your machine.

1. Download the connector again. Return to the command prompt and run the download command again.

   `paconn download`

1. When prompted to select an environment, enter the number for the environment where you installed the solution and then press the **Enter** key.

1. Provide the number of the **Contoso Invoicing - Open Source** connector and then press the **Enter** key.

1. The download should complete successfully. Note the location where the connector was downloaded.

1. Run the validate command by using the path that you copied plus the API definition Swagger file name **\apiDefinition.swagger.json**.

   `paconn validate --api-def [Path to apiDefinition.swagger.json]`

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > [![Validation error.](../media/3-12-validation-error.png)](../media/3-12-validation-error.png#lightbox)

1. Go to the connector folder that you downloaded and open the **apiDefinition.swagger.json** file by using the text editor of your choice, such as Notepad.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > [![Open connector definition file.](../media/3-13-open-file.png)](../media/3-13-open-file.png#lightbox)

1. Add a contact property to the information after the description property.

   ```json
   "contact": {
     "name": "Contoso Support",
     "url": "https://contosoinvoicingtest.azurewebsites.net",
     "email": "info@Contoso.com"
   }
   ```

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > [![Screenshot of the contact parameter added to the Swagger definition with a comma at the end of the description property.](../media/3-14-add-contact.png)](../media/3-14-add-contact.png#lightbox)

1. Add connector metadata after the information.

   ```json
   "x-ms-connector-metadata": [
     {
      "propertyName": "Website",
      "propertyValue": "https://contosoinvoicingtest.azurewebsites.net"
     },
     {
      "propertyName": "Privacy policy",
      "propertyValue": "https://contosoinvoicingtest.azurewebsites.net"
     },
     {
      "propertyName": "Categories",
      "propertyValue": "Productivity"
     }
   ],
   ```

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > [![Screenshot of connector metadata added after the info with a comma at the end of the info section.](../media/3-15-add-metadata.png)](../media/3-15-add-metadata.png#lightbox)

1. Select **File** and **Save** your changes.

1. Run the validate command one more time.

   `paconn validate --api-def [Path to apiDefinition.swagger.json]`

1. The connector should now get validated successfully.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of the successful connector validation.](../media/3-16-validation-success.png)](../media/3-16-validation-success.png#lightbox)

You've successfully prepared the connector to be created as open source and then certified. If you were building a real connector, you would go on to publish the connector to GitHub.
