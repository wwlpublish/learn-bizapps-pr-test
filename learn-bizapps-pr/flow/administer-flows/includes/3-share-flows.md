In the Power Automate mobile app, you can share button flows with other users 
or groups in your organization. The users or groups with whom you share a button 
can then run it the same way they run their own buttons.

You can also share a link to buttons that another person shared with you.

You can stop sharing your buttons at any time.

The screenshots in this unit were taken on a Apple iOS device. If you're using 
an Android or Windows device, what you see might differ, but the functionality 
is the same.

## Prerequisites

* An account that has access to [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com).

## Require users to use their own connections

When you share a button with other people, you can either let them use all the connections that the button uses or require that they use their own connections. Follow these steps to require the people with whom you share your button to use their own connections.

> [!NOTE]
> If you let other people use your connections, they can't access the credentials in your connection. They also can't reuse those connections in any other flow.

1. On the page that appears immediately after you share a button, select **Manage connections**.

1. Select **Edit** for the connection that you want to manage.

1. Select **Provided by user** or your email address to specify whose connections must be used in the shared button.
