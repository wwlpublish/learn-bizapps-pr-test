In this module, you learned about templates, including who creates them,
how they get published, and who can access them. You also discovered that
templates can be a useful tool regardless of your role in an organization. 

Some people might seek to use templates to automate their Office 365 activities, 
but as you also discovered, templates exist that can help you manage 
your governance needs. Additionally, you built a flow that helps administrators manage 
an Office 365 group that you can use to communicate change management and governance 
information to your app makers.
