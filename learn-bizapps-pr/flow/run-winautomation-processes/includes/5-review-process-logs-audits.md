Logs of each process run are visible in the console, allowing users to keep track of every run, regardless of how it was started.

 The logs can be accessed through the Logs tab in the WinAutomation console.

Results can be filtered based on the processes whose run you wish to monitor. As can be seen in the main pane, information about the invocation of a process and its start and end point are available.
