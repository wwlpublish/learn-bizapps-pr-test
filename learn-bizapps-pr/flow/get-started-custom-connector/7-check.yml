  title: Answer the following questions to see what you've learned. 
  questions: 
  - content: You have been asked to build a Power Automate flow that uses an API from Fabrikam. You have decided to build a custom connector because a built-in connector isn't available for the API. After reviewing the API documentation, you discover that it has an Open API definition file and examples that could be used with Postman. Considering the possibilities, which approach makes the most sense to quickly get started building the custom connector?
    choices: 
    - content: Use the examples, build a Postman collection, and then import that collection.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Though you could take this approach, it's not the fastest way to get started with a custom connector when you already have an Open API definition.
    - content: Import the Open API definition file to start your custom connector configuration.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: When available, importing an Open API is the fastest approach. It allows bringing in operations and security details to start your custom connector configuration.
    - content: Use the Open API file as a reference and then manually add the actions to your new custom connector.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Though you could use this approach, it's not the fastest way to get started with a custom connector when you already have an Open API definition.
    - content: Run the samples, capture the network trace, and upload the trace to create the connector.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Network trace is not a valid source of the API definitions.
  - content: Which of the following authentication types is not supported by custom connectors?
    choices: 
    - content: Anonymous
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: This is a supported authentication type.
    - content: Cookie Authentication
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: While a valid authentication pattern, Cookie Authentication is not supported by custom connectors.
    - content: API Key
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: This is a supported authentication type.
    - content: OAuth 2.0
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: This is a supported authentication type.
  - content: You have built a custom connector and want to make it available to other companies, similar to built-in connectors. What should you do?
    choices: 
    - content: Share the connector in the portal.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: This option only allows you to let people in your own company's environment use the connection.
    - content: Submit the connector for certification.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: After it has been certified, your connector will be available to all customers in their own environments.
    - content: Publish your connector on Microsoft AppSource.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: To publish, you need to submit for certification.
    - content: Publish the connector on GitHub as an open source.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: It is not possible to use open-source connectors in the same way as built-in ones.
  - content: You have imported an Open API definition and it included 10 actions. For now, two actions should not be visible to users of the connectors, but you might make them available later. What should you do to implement this preference?
    choices: 
    - content: Add words (HIDDEN) to the actions' names.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: The name of the action has no impact on its visibility.
    - content: Select them as internal.
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: This selection prevents the actions from showing but retains their definition for future use.
    - content: Share only the actions that you want people to use.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: You share at the connector level, not at the action level.
    - content: Disable access to actions in a security role.
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Security roles don't apply to connector actions.
