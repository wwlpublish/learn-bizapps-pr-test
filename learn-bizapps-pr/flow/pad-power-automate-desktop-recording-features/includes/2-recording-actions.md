The **desktop and web recorders** are used to assist users in the development of flows. Using a recorder, users can perform the task manually, and Power Automate Desktop will automatically generate actions to mimic the user’s behavior.

There are two types of recorders in Power Automate Desktop:

* The desktop recorder, used for Windows/UI and Keyboard/Mouse related actions
* The web recorder, used for automating web browser-related actions

Each of these recorders allows the automatic creation of actions based on the user’s manual task.

## Accessing the recorders

The recorders can be used to jump-start the development of a flow; during manual development, locate the two dedicated buttons in the flow designer:

Selecting either button will open the corresponding recorder.

## The desktop recorder

When the **desktop recorder** is launched, the recorder window will appear:

This is where a preview of the recorded actions will appear during the recording:

## The web recorder

When the **web recorder** is launched, the user will be prompted to select a web browser:

After a browser is selected, the recorder window will appear, as in the desktop recorder.
