Conditional actions allow you to modify process actions at runtime, based on information available in the environment. They are divided into two major categories in WinAutomation:
* The If group of actions
* The Switch group of actions

Switch may be used to compare a single variable to multiple values, while If allows more diverse comparisons.

All conditionals allow the definition of one or more alternative comparisons, as well as a final, unconditional alternative, to run when none of the conditions have been met.
