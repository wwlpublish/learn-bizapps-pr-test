Power Automate for desktop enables you to interact with any web application through UI elements. You can consider UI elements as web components, such as buttons and text fields.

To specify a UI element, you have to create Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) selectors that pinpoint the specific component you want to interact with.

When you create a new UI element, the platform store it in the **UI elements pane**, located on the right side of the **flow designer**.

All the actions that handle specific components in web pages require UI elements as input parameters. To create a UI element, follow the following steps:

1. Open the action's properties and select the **UI element** drop-down menu.

    ![Screenshot of the U I element field in the Click link on web page action.](..\media\click-link-on-web-page-action-ui-element-field.png)

1. Select one of the already created UI elements or create a new one through the **Add UI element** button.

1. If you chose to create a new one, use the **Live helpers** (red boxes) to select the desired component.

1. Press **Ctrl + left-click** while the desired component is selected to create a new UI element for it.

1. Confirm the selection in the **Tracking session** dialog.

In the next part of the unit, we'll describe the functionality of all the web actions that use UI elements as input parameters.

## Click link on web page

In some cases, you might need to navigate manually to a web page by clicking a link instead of using the **Go to web page** action. In these cases, you can use the **Click link on web page** action that enables you to select links or other clickable components on web pages.

In the action's properties, you have to populate a UI element describing the exact component to select and a browser instance.

## Click download link on web page

If you want to click a download link, you can use the **Click download link on web page**  action instead of the **Click link on web page** action. Apart from the link selection itself, this action automatically handles the pop-up dialog boxes and saves the downloaded file in a specified folder.

Like the **Click link on web page** action, the **Click download link on web page** action requires a browser instance and a UI element describing the link.

## Hover mouse over element on web page

While automating business procedures, you might want to relocate the mouse pointer to a specific element on a web page. A typical case where you need this functionality is the expansion of hoverable menus.

To achieve this functionality, you can use the **Hover mouse over element on web page** action. Inside the action, you have to specify the browser instance and a UI element describing the component to hover over.

## Populate text field on web page

While filling forms, it is common to populate text fields. To automate procedures that populate this kind of fields, you can use the **Populate text field on web page** action.

In the action's properties, you have to set the text to write, the browser instance, and the UI element describing the text field. Additionally, you can determine whether the action will emulate typing.

## Focus text field on web page

Although Power Automate for desktop provides an action to populate text fields automatically, you might want to just set the input focus on them.

The platform enables you to do that through the **Focus text field on web page** action. In the action's properties, you have to populate a UI element describing the text box and a browser instance.

## Set checkbox state on web page and select radio button on web page

Except for text fields, the majority of the web forms contain checkboxes and radio buttons.

To enable or disable checkboxes, you can use the **Set checkbox state on web page** action. This action requires the checkbox's desired state, a browser instance, and a UI element describing the check box.

To select a radio button, use the **Select radio button on web page** action. Like the **Set checkbox state on web page** action,  you have to define a browser instance and a UI element describing the button.

## Set drop-down list value on web page

Some relatively common components in webpages and web forms are the drop-down lists. Drop-down lists allow you to select a single option from a provided list of options. To automate these components, you can use the **Set drop-down list value on web page** action.

This action enables you to select the desired option through its name or index. In the action's properties, you have to populate a browser instance and a UI element describing the drop-down list.

## Press button on web page

The last action to handle web forms is the **Press button on web page** action. Through this action, you can press buttons on web pages. To specify the button to press, you have to create a UI element, while the action also requires a browser instance.
