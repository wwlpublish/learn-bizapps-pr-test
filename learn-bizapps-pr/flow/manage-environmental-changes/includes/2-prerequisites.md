The Introduction to Power Automate security and governance module
of this learning path explained tenant and environment scopes as 
they relate to Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies. This module explores the Admin Analytics

these assets to possess environment admin permissions.

In regard to managing tenant-scoped assets, the person who is 
administrating these assets must possess tenant admin permissions.
