Communicating changes to DLP can be a challenging endeavor and will
differ depending on organization design. You can use certain
approaches to communicate DLP change information to your makers.

Consider the following strategies:

1. Create an Intranet/Wiki site that can be used for app makers to
    reference so they understand what DLP policies exist.

2. Track all flow users in a digital list. This list can be a Yammer group,
    Microsoft Lists, distribution list, or Microsoft Azure Active Directory group.
    You could also use Microsoft Power Platform Center of Excellence (COE) Starter
    Kit.

3. Communicate upcoming DLP changes in your IT change management
    meetings. An IT change board is a common vehicle for IT
    organizations to communicate changes. Part of their purpose is to
    ensure that the right level of accuracy is applied to changes, but these
    meetings are also used to communicate changes to other stakeholders
    who might have a dependency on your service.

4. Send out advance notice to all makers of upcoming DLP changes by
    using the digital list that was previously discussed. Ideally,
    this process is also automated, by using Power Automate, to reduce
    manual activities.

5. Provide a channel, like a distribution list or service desk queue,
    for makers to communicate with if they have questions or
    concerns. As part of the communication that is sent out, ensure
    that makers have an outlet that they can use to request additional
    assistance if required.

6. Be prepared for exceptions. The Introduction to Microsoft Power Platform
    security and governance module discussed the need for
    exception environments where DLP rules are relaxed. As part of the
    communication that goes out to makers, they might have a legitimate
    need to continue using connectors in their current configuration.
    To address these needs, organizations should consider automating this
    process by using a Microsoft Form that connects to a Power Automate
    flow that includes automated approvals.
