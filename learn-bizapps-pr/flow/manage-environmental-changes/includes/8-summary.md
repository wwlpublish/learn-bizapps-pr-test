You have learned about the strategies that are used to establish governance 
and change management processes. Additionally, you discovered that the governance 
tools that Microsoft provides can be used for change management purposes. 
When makers use Power Platform tools to improve their productivity, 
administrators should try to encourage those users to help scale the organization.

The Admin Analytics feature, found in the Power Platform Admin center, is a 
valuable tool for administrators to get insights into their users. This feature 
doesn’t require any intervention by an administrator. It's refreshed automatically 
and keeps data for 28 days.

For situations where administrators want more control, you will have access to many 
PowerShell cmdlets that can help you provide administrators with more 
visibility into their user’s actions. 

One benefit of using these cmdlets is that the data can be exported as CSV files, 
meaning that they can be loaded into an organization’s business intelligence 
tools. In addition to the tools discussed in this module, in the next module, you'll learn about how to search Office 365 Security and Compliance logs by using a flow template for Power Automate events. By using this flow, you can detect 
when new events occur, such as newly created flows.
