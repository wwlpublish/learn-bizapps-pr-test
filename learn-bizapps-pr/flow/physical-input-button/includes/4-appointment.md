Congratulations, you have now successfully built a flow that triggers by use of a physical button.
To test the flow, you need to have the Flic app open on your phone and then select the Flic
button once. The flow will check to see if any meetings are currently happening or are
pending between now and the next hour, and then it will send out a notification to all attendees.
