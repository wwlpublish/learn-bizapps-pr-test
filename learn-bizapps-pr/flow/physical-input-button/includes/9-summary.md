Power Automate physical buttons can make the process of running a
button flow efficient with a tap or click of a button on a mobile device. 

This module used the Flic app and connector to demonstrate how you can automate 
business processes so that a flow can perform tasks that provide information like 
start and end times of an appointment to your manager and others. Button flows 
can also be used to perform other tasks such as sending emails or messages to 
notify others of your location.
