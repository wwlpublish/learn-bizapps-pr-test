Automating repetitive tasks will allow you to increase productivity and to spend time on more meaningful tasks. To automate desktop action effectively, you need to define the actions and define inputs and outputs. It wouldn't be nearly as useful to write a flow that put in the exact same invoice for every run. In this module, you will learn how to optimally use desktop flows by defining and altering the information that is used in them.

In this module, you will:

- Create a desktop flow with predefined inputs.

- Record actions that are performed in the desktop-based Contoso Invoicing application by using these inputs and capturing application data for output.

- Perform a test run of a new desktop flow with a new set of inputs.

If you do not already have a desktop flow from which you can set inputs and outputs, you might want to refer to the module on creating your first Power Automate Desktop flow.
