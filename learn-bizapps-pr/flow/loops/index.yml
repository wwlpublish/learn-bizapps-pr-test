title: Automating repetitive tasks using loops in WinAutomation
summary: |  
  [!include[](../includes/module-banner.md)] 
  Loops are used to automate repetitive tasks by executing a block of actions multiple times.
abstract: |  
    In this module, you will: 
    - Use simple Loops to perform a given number of repetitions and iterate through data
    - Deploy Loop Conditions in order to repeat Actions until a condition is met
    - Iterate through the items of a list using For Each loops
    - Explicitly end loops when required
prerequisites: |
    - Basic familiarity with the WinAutomation Process Designer
    - Basic familiarity with Lists, Tables, and the square brackets notation
