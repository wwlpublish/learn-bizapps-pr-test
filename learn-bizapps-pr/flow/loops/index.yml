title: Automate repetitive tasks using loops in WinAutomation
summary: |  
  [!include[](../includes/module-banner.md)] 
  Loops are used to automate repetitive tasks by executing a block of actions multiple times.
abstract: |  
    In this module, you will: 
    - Use simple loops to perform a given number of repetitions and iterate through data
    - Deploy loop conditions in order to repeat actions until a condition is met
    - Iterate through the items of a list using for each loops
    - Explicitly end loops when required
