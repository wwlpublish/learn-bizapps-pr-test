title: Synchronization actions in WinAutomation
summary: |  
  [!include[](../includes/module-banner.md)] 
  WinAutomation supports parallel implementation of many instances of the same process. In situations where parallel implementation is unwanted, the synchronization actions can prevent actions from being run simultaneously in multiple process instances.
abstract: |  
    In this module, you will: 
    - Learn when to prevent parallel implementation.
    - Configure synchronization actions.
    - Create a process with synchronization actions to prevent simultaneous access to a file. 
prerequisites: |
    - Basic familiarity with the WinAutomation Console and Process Designer
    - Basic familiarity with process development and variables
