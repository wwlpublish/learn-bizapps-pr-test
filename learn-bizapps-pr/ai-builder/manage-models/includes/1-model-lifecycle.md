In this unit, you will learn how your model can develop over time.

An AI Builder model goes through several stages as it evolves from when
you create it through publishing, sharing, and use. Let's walk through
each of those stages.

### Create your model

As we learned in the first module, you can find all the AI Builder model
types and capabilities on the Build page, which you can access from the
left-side menu. This is where you start to create a new custom AI model,
or select a prebuilt model that you can use right away.

### Draft models

When you've made progress building and customizing your AI model, you
can save a draft to finish later. You can come back at any time and
continue where you left off.

### Trained models

After you have finished building your AI model, you're ready to train
it. During training, your model learns from your data to perform to your
specifications. The time it takes for your model to train depends on the
size of your data.

After training is complete, you can view additional training and
performance information on the details page. In some cases, you can also
quick test to see your model live in action.

### Published models

If you are satisfied with your model, you're ready to publish it. You
have to publish a model before it can be available to use in Power Apps
and Power Automate, so it's important not miss this step.

### Keep track of your model

Any models you create can be accessed at any time by visiting the Models
page, which you can access from the left-side menu in AI Builder. The
Models page shows a complete list of your models, as well as their date
of latest training and the various states we've learned about here.

### What's next?

In this next unit, we'll learn how to edit your model to improve its
performance, and how to manage multiple model versions.
