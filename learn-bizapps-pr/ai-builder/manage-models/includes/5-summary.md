In this module, you learned all about the lifecycle of a model, managing
model versions, and sharing your model.

Specifically, you learned that:

-   A model can assume various states between the time it was created
    and the time it is being used.

-   You can have multiple versions of your model so you can use your
    model and continue to improve it at the same time.

-   You can share your model for it to be used by others in your
    organization.
