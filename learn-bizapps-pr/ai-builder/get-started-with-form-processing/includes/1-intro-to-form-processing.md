Form processing lets you read and save information from standard
documents, such as invoices or tax documents. When you automate this
process, you can save valuable time by reviewing, extracting,
organizing, and saving the data automatically by using Power Apps and
Power Automate.

## Form processing defined

Form processing is one of the many AI capabilities that are offered as a
part of AI Builder. A Form processing model will learn the layout of
your document so that it can best detect and extract the form fields
that you want to save, whether the form is made up of printed text or
handwriting.

The layout of your document is learned by training your model. You can
use images or PDFs of your documents to train your model, but
text-embedded PDFs will provide the best results. Images should be as
high-quality as possible to avoid any issues in detecting text. Only
documents with the same layout should be used.

## What you can do with Form processing

You can use Form processing to automatically process documents.
Companies often receive invoices in large quantities and from a variety
of sources, such as mail, fax, email, or in person. Processing these
documents and manually entering them into your database can take a
considerable amount of time. By using AI to extract the text, key/value
pairs, and tables from your documents, you can create workflows to
automatically pipe the information into your database. You can even
create an app to review the information.

## Next steps

Now that you've learned about the basics behind the Form processing AI
capability, you can create your first Form processing model.
