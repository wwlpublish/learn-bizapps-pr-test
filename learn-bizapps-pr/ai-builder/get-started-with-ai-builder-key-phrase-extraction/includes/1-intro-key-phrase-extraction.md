Before you follow this course, we recommend that you read the [Get Started with **AI Builder** module and [What is AI Builder?](https://docs.microsoft.com/ai-builder/overview) documentation.

AI Builder Key phrase extraction is a prebuilt AI model that identifies the key talking points from unstructured text. Custom AI models require that you provide data samples to train before they can be used. Prebuilt models are pre-trained with data from Microsoft, so they are ready to use right away.

AI Builder Key phrase extraction identifies the key phrases in text by using [Azure Cognitive Services Text analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/overview) technology. Refer to this documentation for supported languages.

Many possible business applications are available to help with key phrase extraction for your business. These applications are covered later in this module.

After the text is analyzed, a maker can retrieve the key phrases to use in their Power Apps and Power Automate business processes.
