AI Builder Key phrase extraction provides makers with the ability to identify key phrases in entered text. Being fully integrated with the rest of the business platform means that you can automate a wide range of scenarios that are currently only achieved with human intervention.

### Use case: Resource planning and trend analysis

Use extracted key phrases from customer surveys for resource planning and trend analysis.

**Example:** 

Incoming customer survey feedback from digital forms or other channels can be sent to AI Builder to detect key phrases. The extracted key phrases can be saved in Microsoft Dynamics CRM and then used to categorize the requests for resource planning and trend analysis.

### Use case: Support incident routing 

Use extracted key phrases to correctly route the support incidents to the right agents.

**Example:** 

A customer sends feedback indicating that they are upset about not being able to access their account. Additionally, the customer mentions that they didn't receive notification regarding possible site maintenance. This event triggers a Power Automate flow to extract the key phrases. The extracted phrase is identified as account related, and the flow then sends a notification to the account management team.

The account management team immediately responds to the customer with the explanation that weekly site maintenance typically lasts a couple of hours, between 12:00 AM to 2:00 AM, and that the account information will be available soon.

This automated routing of the issue reduces the time to respond back to the customer, which creates a better customer experience.

### Use case: Employee morale and workplace health sentiment analysis 

Employee morale and workplace health are important signals about the wellbeing of a company. Key phrase extraction can be used to extract the key phrases from employees' survey comments so you can understand the key topics.

**Example:** 

An HR manager wants to better understand employees' feedback about the new HR healthcare policy that is being considered by the company. The manager extracts key phrases from employee comments in the survey. The AI model identifies that one of the top topics is the policy deductible.

As a result, before making the final decision on the healthcare policy, the manager sets up a conference call to explain it in detail to employees.

Now, you have gained insight into business scenarios that could be enhanced with help from AI Builder Key phrase extraction.
