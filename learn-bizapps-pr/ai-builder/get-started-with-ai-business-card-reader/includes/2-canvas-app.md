Your goal for this exercise is to take a picture or upload an existing photo from the file system and extract contact information that is present in the image. You will then build a canvas app in Power Apps and use the Business card reader component. 

For more information, see the [What are canvas apps in Power Apps?](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/getting-started) and the [Use the Business card reader component in a canvas app](https://docs.microsoft.com/ai-builder/business-card-reader-component-in-powerapps) documentation.

### Create an application in Power Apps

1. Select **Create** in the Power Apps left menu and then select **Canvas app from blank**. 
2. Name the canvas app **Contoso Business card reader**.
3. Select **Phone**. 
4. Select **Create**.

### Enable automatic retrieval of contact information from business cards

### Bind the contact information to an existing entity from Common Data Service

1. Select **Insert a new Form in edition mode**. 
2. Change the **Default mode** property to **New** and the **Data source** property to the **Contacts** entity.

Business card reader can extract 18 different fields from business cards. For this example, you will add the **Website** field.

### Bind the extracted contact information to the form

1. Go to each of the form's data cards and, in the **Advanced** tab, select **Unlock to change properties**.

    ![In the Advanced tab, select Unlock to change properties.](../media/image3.png)

2. You can now change the default value of each data card to map the Business card reader extracted properties. Set the following default values:

   - **Full Name\_DataCard1** - BusinessCardReader1.FullName

   - **Email\_DataCard1** - BusinessCardReader1.Email

   - **Business Phone\_ DataCard1** - BusinessCardReader1.BusinessPhone

   - **Website\_ DataCard1** - BusinessCardReader1.Website

You can always add more fields to be mapped. For this example, you can extract the following list of fields from your business cards.
