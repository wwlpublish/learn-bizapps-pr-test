Before you begin this course, we recommend that you read the **Get started with AI Builder** module and the "What is AI Builder?" documentation.

AI Builder Language detection is a prebuilt AI model that identifies the language of text. Custom AI models require that you provide data samples to train with before you can use them. Prebuilt models are pre-trained with data from Microsoft, so they are ready to use right away.

AI Builder Language detection identifies the language of the text by using [Azure Cognitive Services Text analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/overview) technology. Refer to the Language and Region Support for the Text Analytics API documentation for supported languages.

You can choose from many possible business applications for language detection for your business. These applications are covered later in this module.

After the text is analyzed, a maker can retrieve the recognized text to use in Power Apps and Power Automate business processes.
