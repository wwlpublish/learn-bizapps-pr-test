To help your customers gain the full power of Excel and Power BI, you may need to provide some of them with technical training on how to use paginated reports. 

This train-the-trainer course will prepare you to deliver the **Designing Report Layouts** module of the **Power BI Paginated Reports in a Day** instructor-led course.   
That course will take your customers on a journey to develop and then publish paginated reports with Power BI. By the end of your delivery, you will have alleviated some of their reporting concerns and moved your sales forward.  

Depending on your customers’ needs you may want to deliver this module by itself, or with some or all the other modules in the **Power BI Paginated Reports in a Day** course to help close sales.

## Designing Report Layouts
Making a report that is easy for the user to understand is the difference between helping your organization be successful, accidentally generating fear, uncertainty, and doubt.

In this module we’ll cover how to explain and demostrate:
- Designing report layouts
- Setting dynamic properties

> [!TIP]
> You will likely need to deliver this module to some of your customers to help close sales. As you take this module consider how you and your partners could present the content to your customers. 

### Report design process
A typical development methodology covers these steps:
1. Create the report
1. Create a data source
1. Define dataset(s) to retrieve data
1. Define report parameters
1. Design the report layout
1. Test the report design (in preview mode)
1. Publish the report to the Power BI service
1. Configure any post-publication tasks

This development methodology is not set in stone. It is intended to provide a general overview of what’s involved when authoring and publishing reports. 

> [!TIP]
> Be sure to check with your customer for their design methodology before teaching this one.
> The closer that the methodology you teach is to your student's experience, the easier this content will be to learn.
