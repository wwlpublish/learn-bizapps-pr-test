## Introducing Power BI
Power BI supports two different report types:
- Power BI reports
- Power BI paginated reports

> [!NOTE]
> Your students may confuse paginated reports that are stored on Power BI Service with Power BI Report Server. Report Server is for on-premises scenarios.  
> This course doesn't cover Power BI Report Server. However, reports can be migrated to Power BI Service from SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) or Power BI Report Server
