The key message is on the first slide of this module:

**Learning Power Pivot in Excel is a 2 for 1 deal!**

- What you learn in Excel is applicable to Power BI Desktop
- Only the look & feel is different from Excel to Power BI Desktop
- … And maybe there are a few Menu and Button name differences!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your goal in this module is to help your students leverage what they already know about Power Pivot tables and extend that knowledge into Power BI Desktop.

We are now at step 3 of the course journey:
1. We level set with the class on Pivot tables.
1. We introduced Power Pivot in Excel as an extension of what they knew about Pivot tables.
1. We now are introducing Power BI as an extension of what they just learned about Power Pivot in Excel.

To do this you will show a side by side comparison of Power BI and Excel
