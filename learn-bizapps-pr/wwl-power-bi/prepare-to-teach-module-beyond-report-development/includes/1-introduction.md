To help your customers gain the full power of Excel and Power BI, you may need to provide some of them with technical training on how to use paginated reports. 

This train-the-trainer course will prepare you to deliver the **Beyond Report Development** module of the **Power BI Paginated Reports in a Day** instructor-led course. 
That course will take your customers on a journey in to develop and then publish paginated reports with Power BI. By the end of your delivery, you will have alleviated some of their reporting concerns and moved your sales forward.  

Depending on your customers’ needs you may want to deliver this module by itself, or with the other modules in the **Power BI Paginated Reports in a Day** course to help close sales.

In this seventh module we’ll cover how to teach and demonstrate what happens once the report is finished:

- Publishing reports

- Delivering reports
- Embedding reports
- When to use paginated reports
- Licensing
