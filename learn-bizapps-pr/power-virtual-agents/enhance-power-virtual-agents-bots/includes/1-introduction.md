Microsoft Power Virtual Agents empowers your teams to create powerful bots through a guided, no-code graphical interface. This ability allows you to use the benefits of bots without having to rely on data scientists or developers, and it helps to address many of today's challenges in building bots. With Power Virtual Agents, you can eliminate the gap between the subject matter experts and development teams that are building the bots, and you can reduce latency between teams recognizing an issue and updating the bot to address the issue. Power Virtual Agents also removes the complexity of exposing teams to the nuances of conversational AI and the need to write complex code.

Power Virtual Agents helps make creating bots quick and simple, and it includes the following features that help you enhance your bot's functionality to make it even more powerful:

- **Initiate Microsoft Power Automate flows** - You can initiate Power Automate flows directly from topics in your bot. This feature allows you to include personalized information for other services in the message content that is being provided.

- **Pass conversations to live agents** - Bots can be configured to pass conversations, including the context of the conversation, to applications such as Omnichannel for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Service, where live agents can take over the task of working on the conversation.

- **Automate topic creation** - You can extract content from existing support pages, such as Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), and then convert it into bot topics that can be used in conversations. Topics can also be created from topics that are suggested in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Service Insights.

This module will examine some of the additional capabilities that are available to help you enhance your Power Virtual Agents bots.
