Employees who have quick access to information make better decisions, reduce errors, and save money. Chatbots create a personalized experience that simplifies how employees get information. Microsoft Power Virtual Agents and Microsoft Dataverse for Teams create intelligent chatbots to quickly respond to employee needs without building high-code solutions.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

-   Create a chatbot.

-   Use the chatbot to call Microsoft Power Automate actions to retrieve data from Dataverse for Teams.

-   Publish the chatbot to your team or the whole company.

This module goes through the process of creating, editing, and then publishing a chatbot that provides contact information for an event planning team.
